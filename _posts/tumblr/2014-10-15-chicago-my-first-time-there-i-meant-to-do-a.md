Chicago! My first time there. I meant to do a whole write up about my amazing food experiences there, but grad school. Sooo … a few notes…
Avec. UGH. Chorizo dates.
Slurping Turtle. Thanks Takashi!
Eataly. Sweet prosciutto, all the wine.
The Little Goat. Fried chicken french toast, holy moly.
Frontera. Esquites!

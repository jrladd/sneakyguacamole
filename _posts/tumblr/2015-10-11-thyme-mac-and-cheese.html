<p>This was a rare occasion where I found the original recipe I referred to to be not very well written. Therefore, I’ve adjusted the recipe where needed, and in the end, it really was a good mac and cheese. <a href="http://chasingdelicious.com/baked-thyme-mac-cheese/">Via Chasing Delicious.</a></p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="3264" data-orig-width="2448"><img src="http://67.media.tumblr.com/34d9785588dbd0f6ee9ab993fb9bfcac/tumblr_inline_nvofqcAp8U1son4ik_540.jpg" data-orig-height="3264" data-orig-width="2448"/></figure><ul><li>½ pound miniature elbow pasta</li><li>2 oz butter</li><li>1 small onion, finely sliced</li><li>1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves, finely chopped</li><li>¼ cup flour</li><li>2 cups milk, warm</li><li>1 cup cream, warm</li><li>1 bay leaf</li><li>12 ounces cheese, chopped into small chunks or grated</li><li>Salt &amp; Pepper to taste</li><li>2 ounces parmesan cheese, grated</li></ul><p>Instructions</p><ol><li>Preheat an oven to 350°F.

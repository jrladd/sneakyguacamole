<p>Recently, my food blogging significantly fell off and that’s because my fella and I got married last month! However, now my blogging should increase because I get to play with all the new kitchen tools people were kind enough to gift to us. Two such treats play into this fantastic recipe: our new waffle maker and Kenji Lopez-Alt’s <i><a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/the-food-lab">The Food Lab</a> </i>cookbook<i>. </i>While sometimes better cooking through science seems like a headache, it usually does produce better quality dishes; so while I was like, club soda? Stiff peaked eggs whites?! Woof. This recipe did create incredibly fluffy waffles and was worth the small amount of extra effort.</p><figure data-orig-width="3264" data-orig-height="2448" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://66.media.tumblr.com/00c2c5e932c1fdcb4eaf86e440f02bf6/tumblr_inline_o5dvp08dTJ1son4ik_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="3264" data-orig-height="2448"/></figure><p>*This made about 5 waffles in my electric Belgian waffle maker. </p><ul><li>1 recipe Basic Dry Pancake Mix<i> [*see recipe below]</i><br/></li><li>2 large eggs</li><li>1 &frac12; cups buttermilk</li><li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li><li>1 cup ice-cold club soda</li><li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li><li>Butter or oil for the waffle iron</li><li>Maple Syrup</li></ul><ol><li>Preheat an electric waffle iron, on the low-heat setting if you have the option, or heat a stovetop waffle iron over medium-low heat.

If using a Belgian waffle iron, scoop &frac14; cup batter into each well, close the iron, and immediately flip it, then continue cooking, turning occasionally, until the waffles are golden brown and crisp on both sides, about 10 minutes. If using an electric waffle iron, preheat and cook according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

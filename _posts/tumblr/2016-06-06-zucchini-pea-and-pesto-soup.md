Man, was this fresh! I’ve decided that while zucchini are fine, I don’t really love them. They often get mushy in recipes. However, this recipe proves how great they can be! Sliced larger and not cooked long enough to become spongy, the zucchini is fantastic in this recipe. In general, this soup is reminiscent of a soup au pistou, which I love! Why not stir pesto into all soups … ? Via BBC Good Food. 1 tbsp olive oil1 garlic clove, sliced1 lb zucchini (or courgettes, since this is from a British source), quartered lengthways and chopped1/3-½ lb frozen peas1 can cannellini beans, drained and rinsed1 quart vegetable or chicken stock2 tbsp basil pestoHeat the stock in a saucepan. Once the stock is warm, heat the oil in a large pot/dutch oven. Cook the garlic for a few seconds, then add the zucchini and cook for 3 mins until they start to soften. Stir in the peas and cannellini beans.Pour in the hot stock and cook for a further 3 mins.Stir the pesto through the soup and season as you like. Serve!

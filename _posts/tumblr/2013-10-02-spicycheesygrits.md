This is one of JRL and my go to recipes. Hungry? Whip this up in less than a ½ hr with whatever you have lying around.

Brought to you by Food and Wine and my southern roots.


2 ½ cups water
1 cup milk
2 tablespoons butter
1/8 teaspoon Tabasco sauce [or in my case, Choula]
1/8 teaspoon paprika
1 ¼ teaspoons salt
Cayenne [the more the better]
¾ cup quick-cooking grits
¼ pound cheddar, grated (about 1 cup) [I rock the shredded]
1 red bell pepper, cut into ¾-inch squares
1 green bell pepper, cut into ¾-inch squares
6 scallions including green tops, sliced thin
2 cups drained and rinsed canned black beans [I just do a can]
¼ cup canned low-sodium chicken broth or homemade stock [you can eye ball this, I never use a full ¼ cup]
3 plum tomatoes, chopped [I’m not a tomato fan, it’s my last big food hurdle, but do you]
 
In a medium saucepan, combine the water, milk, 1 tablespoon of the butter, the Tabasco, paprika, 1 teaspoon of the salt, and 1/8 teaspoon cayenne. Bring to a boil over moderately high heat. Add the grits in a slow stream, whisking. Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon, until the grits are very thick, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the cheese. Cover to keep warm.
Meanwhile, in a large nonstick frying pan, melt the remaining tablespoon of butter over moderate heat. Add the bell peppers and scallions and cook, stirring frequently, until the vegetables start to soften, about 5 minutes. Add the beans, broth, ¼ teaspoon cayenne, and the remaining ¼ teaspoon salt. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring frequently, until the beans are hot, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the tomatoes. Serve over the cheese grits.



Sauteing bell peppers– not very interesting. But I grew this pepper and it looked so seductively scarlet that I couldn’t help but post.

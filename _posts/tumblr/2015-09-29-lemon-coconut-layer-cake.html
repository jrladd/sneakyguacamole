<p>This delicious treat celebrated my friend’s academic successes! And what a lovely treat it was. I halved the recipe and made just a two layer cake, but otherwise, who could want more than lemon curd AND coconut?

Prepare 2 8-inch cake pans by lining the bottoms with parchment paper; do not spray the sides. Sift flour and baking powder twice and set aside.<br/></li><li>Using a stand mixer fitted with the whip attachment, whip eggs, salt, sugar and vanilla bean on high for 5 minutes. </li><li>On medium speed, slowly drizzle in oil until fully incorporated. </li><li>On low speed, begin adding 1⁄3 of dry ingredients, alternating with ½ of buttermilk, repeat and finish with remaining dry. Scrape well to make sure there are no lumps and batter is evenly combined. </li><li>Divide batter evenly between 2 pans and bake for 50 to 60 minutes. The cakes will be a medium golden brown and the centers will spring back when lightly pressed if finished. </li><li>Cool completely in the pans and run a knife carefully around the edge to remove.<br/></li></ol><p>| Preparation – American Buttercream |</p><ol><li>Using a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream butter, sugar, salt and vanilla on medium for 1 minute until light and fluffy. </li><li>Add 1⁄8 cup milk on medium and then beat on high, 2 minutes. Adjust consistency with milk as needed. Buttercream should be soft and creamy.<br/></li></ol><p>| Assembly | </p><ol><li>Using a serrated knife, carefully remove domed top of each cake and discard. Cut each cake in half horizontally to create 4 cake layers. </li><li>Place bottom layer onto a cake plate, “gluing” it down with a dab of buttercream. </li><li>Top with ¾ cup lemon curd, spreading evenly to coat. Add next 2 layers in the same manner, saving other bottom layer to invert on top of cake. </li><li>Using a spatula, spread a thin layer of buttercream over the sides, edges and top of cake. </li><li>Chill for 1 hour or up to 1 day to set. </li><li>Once cake is set, spread another ¼-inch layer buttercream over entire cake. Coat cake in coconut flakes, pressing lightly, and dust the excess off plate. </li><li>Chill to set. Cake will keep in the refrigerator for 3 days, but is best after being at room temperature for 2 to 4 hours.<br/></li></ol><p><i>NOTE: I skipped steps 5-7. I just iced the whole cake, added the coconut, then served it. If you have the time, go through the steps, but realize you can always cut corners&hellip; :D</i></p>

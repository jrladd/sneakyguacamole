What’s a Superbowl without delicious wings?! Shout out to my buddy Merrill (one of the few people who reads this blog) who pointed me to this recipe when we decided we wanted to try to replicate Pok Pok’s famous wings. I’m not gonna lie; we kicked ass, and so did these wings. Via Food & Wine. ½ cup Asian fish sauce½ cup superfine sugar [If you don’t want to buy this, just run granulated sugar in a food processor for about 30 seconds. It’s so the sugar will melt more easily into the sauce.]4 garlic cloves, 2 crushed and 2 minced3 pounds chicken wings, split at the drumettes2 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus more for frying1 cup cornstarch1 tablespoon chopped cilantro1 tablespoon chopped mintIn a bowl, whisk the fish sauce, sugar and crushed garlic. Add the wings and toss to coat. Refrigerate for 3 hours, tossing the wings occasionally.Heat the 2 tablespoons of oil in a small skillet. Add the minced garlic; cook over moderate heat until golden, 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels.In a large pot, heat 2 inches of oil to 350°. Pat the wings dry on paper towels; reserve the marinade. Put the cornstarch in a shallow bowl, add the wings and turn to coat. Fry the wings in batches until golden and cooked through, about 10 minutes. [For me, it was more like 8 minutes. Just watch that they don’t brown and don’t be afraid to cut into one and make sure the chicken is cooking through.] Drain on paper towels and transfer to a bowl.In a small saucepan, simmer the marinade over moderately high heat until syrupy, 5 minutes. Strain over the wings and toss. Top with the cilantro, mint and fried garlic and serve.

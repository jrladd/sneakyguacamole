Important note to start: If you’re going to execute this recipe as listed, be mindful that it takes between 12-36 hours. Now, being the silly person I am, I did it all over the course of about 8 (and it still tasted good …), but if you’ve got the time, do it the straight up way. This is probably now my go to cheesecake recipe; it was that good! It also wasn’t hard, just time intensive (with waiting).
2 cups all-purpose flour 
½ cup powdered sugar
¼ teaspoon salt
½ cup cold butter, cubed 
2 egg yolks 
1 to 2 Tbsp. ice-cold water 
4 (8-oz.) packages cream cheese, softened 
1 cup granulated sugar 
4 large eggs 
2 teaspoons vanilla extract 
2 cups Quick and Easy Lemon Curd, divided (see recipe at bottom of page)
Pulse first 3 ingredients in a food processor 3 or 4 times or just until blended. Add butter, and pulse 5 or 6 times or until crumbly. Whisk together egg yolks and 1 Tbsp. ice-cold water in a small bowl; add to butter mixture, and process until dough forms a ball and pulls away from sides of bowl, adding up to 1 Tbsp. remaining ice-cold water, 1 tsp. at a time, if necessary. Shape dough into a disk; wrap in plastic wrap. Chill 4 to 24 hours.
Roll dough into a 14-inch circle on a lightly floured surface. [My mom gave me this great tip. This dough is REALLY apt to breaking. So, roll it out on a floured parchment paper. Then when the doigh is ready, place sprngform pan upside down on the dough, then flip the paper and pan over. This prevents you from haing to lift the sholw dough up and have it split. Man, she’s smart. My dough still did split a bit, but don’t freak out. Just use your fingertips and a bit of water to bring these seams together.] Fit dough into a lightly greased 9-inch dark springform pan, gently pressing on bottom and up sides of pan; trim and discard excess dough. Chill 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, preheat oven to 325°. Beat cream cheese at medium speed with an electric mixer 3 minutes or until smooth. Gradually add granulated sugar, beating until blended. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating just until yellow disappears after each addition. Beat in vanilla.
Pour two-thirds of cheesecake batter (about 4 cups) into prepared crust; dollop 1 cup lemon curd over batter in pan, and gently swirl with a knife. Spoon remaining batter into pan.
Bake at 325° for 1 hour to 1 hour and 10 minutes or just until center is set. When is this? Who knows. I think if the entire cheesecake jiggles just a little, but equally all over, then it’s ready. Turn oven off. Let cheesecake stand in oven, with door closed, 15 minutes. Remove cheesecake from oven, and gently run a knife around outer edge of cheesecake to loosen from sides of pan. (Do not remove sides of pan.) Cool completely in pan on a wire rack (about 1 hour). Cover and chill 8 to 24 hours.
Remove sides of pan, and transfer cheesecake to a serving platter. Spoon remaining 1 cup lemon curd over cheesecake, and, if desired, top with Candied Lemon Slices.

Quick and Easy Lemon Curd
6 lemons
½ cup butter, softened 
2 cups sugar 
4 egg
Step One: Grate zest from lemons to equal 2 Tbsp. Cut lemons in half; squeeze juice into a measuring cup to equal 1 cup.
Step Two: Beat butter and sugar at medium speed with an electric mixer until blended. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating just until blended after each addition. Gradually add lemon juice to butter mixture, beating at low speed just until blended after each addition; stir in zest. (Mixture will look curdled.) Transfer to a 3-qt. microwave-safe bowl.
NOTE: if you don’t have a microwave, like me, skip to step 5 for instructions. Step Three: Microwave at HIGH 5 minutes, stirring at 1-minute intervals. Microwave, stirring at 30-second intervals, 1 to 2 more minutes or until mixture thickens, coats the back of a spoon, and starts to mound slightly when stirred.
Step Four: Place heavy-duty plastic wrap directly on warm curd (to prevent a film from forming), and chill 4 hours or until firm. Store in an airtight container in refrigerator up to 2 weeks.
Stove-Top Method: Prepare as directed through Step 2, transferring mixture to a heavy 4-qt. saucepan. Cook over medium-low heat, whisking constantly, 14 to 16 minutes. Proceed as directed in Step 4.

The answer is always cheese. This Food 52 recipe rocked–the marinade for the halloumi shined– and it’s always good to have a good vegetarian dish in your back pocket. 


1 garlic clove, crushed
1 pinch sea salt flakes
1 teaspoon crushed peppercorns
1 teaspoon dried rosemary
1 teaspoon dried thyme
2 unwaxed lemons, very thinly sliced
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon honey
1 block of halloumi cheese cut into slices about 1 ½ centimeters thick
You will need a hot oven. Preheat the oven to about 200°C (or 400°F). Slice one lemon thinly. Using a pestle and mortar pound the garlic, pinch of salt, herbs, and the peppercorns – add olive oil, honey and lemon juice from the other lemon. Rub the cheese and lemon slices with the mixture. [I don’t own a mortar and pestle, so I just minced the garlic and then mixed everything. I thought the consistency was fine.]
Place it in an ovenproof dish, and let it color and caramelize uncovered for about 10 minutes. Remove and turn over to color the other side. [For me, the cheese never caramelized as the recipe suggests. So to get that charred, grilled look and taste, I seared it under a broiler until a good color (maybe 5 minutes?). However, I don’t know if broiling alone would heat the cheese all the way through, so I would still cook it at 400 degrees for a short time.] Serve lemon side up, sprinkled with the remaining dressing and pan juices drizzled over.

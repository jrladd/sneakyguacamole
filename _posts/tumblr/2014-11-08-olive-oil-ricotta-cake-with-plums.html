<p>This recipe is brought to you by my good friend Merrill, who shared her delish farmer market damson plums and <a href="http://food52.com/blog/8051-olive-oil-ricotta-cake-with-plums">Food 52</a>. This with some greek yogurt? Perfect snack.</p>

<ul><li>butter for pan</li>
<li>1 cup fresh, full-fat ricotta</li>
<li>1/3 cup olive oil</li>
<li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
<li>1 tablespoon freshly grated lemon zest</li>
<li>2 large eggs</li>
<li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>9-10 small plums, halved, pitted, and set aside</li>
<li>1 tablespoon sugar or honey</li>
<li>Confectioner&rsquo;s sugar, for dusting</li>
</ul><ol><li>Preheat your oven to 350° F, and butter and flour a 9-inch springform.</li>
<li>In a large mixing bowl, combine and whisk the ricotta, oil, sugar, and zest together. Add one egg, whisk well; add the next, whisk again.</li>
<li>Sift all of the dry ingredients &ndash; save for the confectioner&rsquo;s sugar &ndash; directly over the wet ingredients you just whisked together. Mix with a spoon gently until just combined. (Use more of a folding motion toward the end &ndash; this will help keep the gluten from developing in your batter, which will keep your cake from toughening or becoming too dense.)</li>
<li>Pour the batter into the cake pan, spreading it out evenly as needed. If your plums are very tart, toss them with a tablespoon of sugar or honey, and place them in the top of the cake, cut-side down (<i>Mine were quite tart so I did this step, but not a whole tablespoon, since I wanted to keep some of the tartness</i>).</li>
<li>Bake for 35 minutes, or until the top is golden brown, the edges are pulling away from the pan, and a cake tester or toothpick comes out of the cake cleanly. (Depending on your oven, this could take up to 45 minutes.) Cool in the pan for 10-15 minutes, then turn out to finish cooling on a rack.</li>
<li>Dust with confectioner&rsquo;s sugar, and serve slightly warm or at room temperature. (<i>This cake keeps well for a few days, but don&rsquo;t dust it with the sugar if you&rsquo;re not eating it all right away. It will get soggy.</i>)</li>

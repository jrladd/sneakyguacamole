When your farmers market finally reopens after a long winter, there’s nothing better than RHUBARB and ASPARAGUS. Thank goodness for spring and tasty tasty scones. Via Food 52. Serves 12-16 scones3 stalks rhubarb2 ½ cups flour1 tablespoon baking powder½ teaspoon salt8 tablespoons unsalted butter½ cup vanilla sugar [If like me, you don’t just have vanilla sugar, you can just leave out the vanilla taste and then I find the scones taste more like English scones/biscuits, or you can add about ½-1 tsp of vanilla–depending on how much vanilla taste you want– to your liquids (the cream) and integrate it into the dough then.]2/3–¾ cups heavy cream [I have also used milk and ½ and ½ in this recipe instead of cream.]Preheat oven to 425.Slice rhubarb stalks ¼ “ thick. Toss with 3 tablespoons of the sugar.Sift flour, baking powder and salt together in large bowl or bowl of food processor.Cut butter into flour mixture by hand (or whiz with food processor) until butter is the size of small peas.Blend in ¼ cup of the sugar.Blend in sliced rhubarb. (If using the food processor, just pulse – you want the slices left mostly intact.)Blend in cream until a soft dough forms. (note: you may need to add more than 2/3 cup depending on the weather,etc.)Transfer dough to floured surface and divide in half. To make triangular scones, flatten into 6-inch disks and cut each circle into 6-8 scones. Sprinkle with remaining sugar.Arrange on ungreased cookie sheet and bake about 20 minutes or until reddish-brown on top.

<p>A first attempt at steak via <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Whats-Dinner-Delicious-Recipes-Busy/dp/0345542525">Curtis Stone&rsquo;s What&rsquo;s For Dinner</a>.</p>

<ul><li>3 tbsp oyster sauce</li>
<li>2 tbsp Chinese rice wine or dry white wine</li>
<li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
<li>2 tbsp canola oil</li>
<li>1 lb flank steak, excess fat trimmed and cut across the grain into &frac14; in slices</li>
<li>1 lg red bell pepper, cored, seeded, and cut into strips</li>
<li>8 oz green beans, trimmed and cut in half on the diagonal</li>
<li>&frac12; cup thinly sliced shallots</li>
<li>2 lg garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
<li>2 tbsp finely chopped peeled fresh ginger</li>
<li>3 lg scallions (white and green parts), thinly sliced on the diagonal</li>
<li>1 tsp toasted sesame oil</li>
<li>fresh cilantro leaves (optional, garnish)</li>
<li>2 tsp sesame seeds (optional, garnish)</li>
<li>rice, for serving</li>
</ul><p>1. In a small bowl, mix &frac14; cup with oyster sauce, rice wine, and soy sauce; set aside. Heat a wok or large skillet over high heat. Add 1 tbsp of the canola oil and swirl it to coat the cooking surface. Add the beef, spreading it out in a single layer, and cook, without stirring, for about 2 minutes, or until well browned on the bottom and remove from pan. <i>[I turned it til I was sure it was brown on all sides.]</i></p>

<p>2. Add the remaining 1 tbsp canola oil to the wok, then add the bell peppers and green beans and cook, stirring often, for about 2 minutes, or until the vegetables soften slightly. Stir in the shallots, garlic, and ginger, then stir the oyster sauce mixture, add to the wok, and cook, stirring often, for about 2 minutes, or until the vegetables are crisp-tender and the sauce has reduced slightly. Return the beef and its accumulated juices to the wok, add the scallions, and stir for about 1 minute, or just until the beef is heated through. Stir in the sesame oil and reduce from heat.</p>
<p>3. Serve over rice!</p>
<p>This wasn&rsquo;t my favorite recipe, but it was good! I think pounding out the steak or slicing it in half long ways would have made the texture of the meat better for me.</p>

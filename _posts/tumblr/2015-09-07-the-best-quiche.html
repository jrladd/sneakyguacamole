<p>In St. Louis we are lucky enough to have not one, but TWO excellent food magazines. Over the past year or so <a href="http://www.feastmagazine.com/">Feast Magazine</a> has included a recipe each month from pastry chef Christy Augustin of <a href="http://pintsizebakery.com/">Pint Size Bakery.</a> Thus, every month I hurriedly flip to her page since every recipe she includes is amazing. By far, my favorite of these is her quiche recipe from the January 2015 issue. I make this quiche at least once a month. Breakfast, lunch, or dinner. NOM. Via <a href="http://www.feastmagazine.com/cook/article_d16758b2-8a0a-11e4-8d69-ef84cf4cea4f.html">Feast Magazine</a>. </p><p>As for quiche fillings, Augustin recommends crispy bacon with chives, sauteed kale with caramelized onions, or even last night’s leftover roast chicken with mushrooms. I’ve tried a couple different fillings but my favorite is just the way she wrote it&ndash; with eggs, cheese, and herbs&ndash; it’s so silky and rich! </p><figure data-orig-width="2445" data-orig-height="2984" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://65.media.tumblr.com/dd328e7beb48aa96896aeaef2ce298b2/tumblr_inline_ntyurlstvA1son4ik_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="2445" data-orig-height="2984"/></figure><p><b>Pâte Brisée (Yields 2 crusts)</b><br/></p><p><i>Note from Augustin: Why go through all the trouble of making pie crust from scratch and not make extra? This recipe creates enough dough to make two pie crusts. If you’re only making one quiche, simply wrap the extra crust tightly and freeze for future use (thaw frozen crust in the refrigerator for several hours before baking). Pie crust dough will keep in the freezer for up to one month.</i><br/></p><ul><li>2 cups unbleached, all-purpose flour</li><li>1 tsp kosher salt</li><li>½ tsp granulated sugar (optional)</li><li>1½ sticks cold unsalted butter, cubed into walnut-sized pieces</li><li>½ cup ice water</li><li>1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar</li></ul><p><b>Quiche Batter (Yields 1 quiche)</b></p><ul><li>3 whole eggs</li><li>2 egg yolks</li><li>¼ cup heavy cream</li><li>½ cup whole milk</li><li>½ cup sour cream or crème fraîche</li><li>2 tsp kosher salt (reduce if your cheeses are saltier)</li><li>1 tsp freshly ground black pepper</li><li>1 Tbsp fresh thyme (or herb of choice)</li><li>1½ to 2 cups crumbled cheese (try local goat cheese, Gorgonzola and Gruyère) <i>[I often include 1 cup of whatever cheese I have, usually cheddar, and &frac12; cup- 1 cup of grated parmesan. I shred the blocks of cheese in my food processor, since I don’t usually keep crumbly cheese.]</i></li></ul><p>| Preparation – Pâte Brisée | In a large bowl, combine flour, salt and sugar. Add half of butter and begin working the fat into the flour by hand until a cornmeal texture is achieved. Add remaining cold butter and rub into flour mix until pieces are the size of hazelnuts. Using a fork, gently toss cold water and vinegar into the mix using to create rough, shaggy dough. It should still be dry and crumbly but comes together when squeezed. Divide mixture in half.<i> [I just do all of these steps in my food processor, in the order she recommends.]</i></p><p>On a lightly floured work surface, smear dough with the heel of your hand, ball it up and repeat 2 to 3 times until a cohesive dough forms. This trick makes the flakiest crust. Form each half into a round, wrap in plastic wrap and chill for 2 hours or up to 2 days before rolling.</p><p>| Preparation – Quiche Batter | Thoroughly whisk all ingredients together, except for thyme and cheese. Refrigerate until ready to use, up to 3 days.</p><p>| Assembly | Preheat oven to 400ºF. Prepare either a 9½-inch-by-10-inch pie pan with pie weights and set aside.<i> </i></p><p>Roll chilled dough on a lightly floured work surface into a circle between 1/8-inch and ¼-inch thick and 12 inches around. Transfer dough into pan, form a crimped edge and thoroughly dock the bottom with a fork. Freeze quiche shell for 20 minutes.</p><p>Line frozen shell with a piece of parchment filled with dried beans or raw rice and transfer to oven to blind-bake for 15 minutes. Remove pie weights and bake another 5 to 10 minutes until dark golden brown. Turn oven down to 350ºF. Fill shell with thyme and cheeses and pour custard batter over top as full as your pan will allow. Bake quiche on a sheet tray for 45 minutes until the top is toasty brown, the center is puffed and the quiche has a nice jiggle when shaken.</p>

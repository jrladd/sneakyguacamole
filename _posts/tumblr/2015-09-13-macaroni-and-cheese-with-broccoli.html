Lightly oil a 9-inch square baking dish, or another baking vessel of your choice. <i>[I used a dutch oven so I could make my mac and cheese sauce and then just add the macaroni to it. Then you also don’t have to cover it with aluminum foil later, as dutch ovens have covers.]</i></li><li>Fill a large pasta pot with salted water and bring to a boil. </li><li>In a medium saucepan <i>[or dutch oven]</i>, bring the stock and milk to boil.

Transfer it all to the baking dish and top with bread crumbs and the rest of the Parmesan. Drizzle with olive oil.

This was a good, if not great, recipe. It could have used a good yogurt sauce (since it was quite spicy!). But, I appreciated how easy it was. Via Carla’s Comfort Foods. [Sorry for my lazy photography; I was really hungry and just wanted to eat it!]2 tbsp olive oil1 medium yellow onion, dicedkosher salt2 garlic cloves, minced2 medium yellow (or red or orange) bell pepper, stemmed, seeded, and diced 1 cup brown (or white) basmati rice2 tsp ground cumin2 tsp ground coriander1 tsp cayenne pepper2 cups water1 lb lambblack pepper1 15-oz can black beans, rinsed and drained1 15-oz can chickpeas, rinsed and drainedchopped fresh cilantro, mint, and/or flat-leaf parsley leaves, for servingHeat the oil in a large Dutch oven or flameproof casserole over medium-high heat. Add the onion and ½ tsp salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until just tender, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the bell pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.Add the rice, cumin, coriander, and cayenne and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the water and bring to a boil. Then cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the rice is just tender, about 30 minutes. [Fair warning, I don’t know if it was because of the shape of my dutch oven or what, but cooking the rice took more like 50 minutes-1 hr.]Meanwhile, heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Add the lamb and press it into the pan in a single layer. Sprinkle with 1 tsp salt and ½ tsp pepper. Just let it sit to get some color, about 10 minutes. When it’s really browned on the bottom, stir it around to make sure it’s all cooked. Drain in a colander. [I thought this instruction was strange: why not just brown the meat normally? But I tried it and I see what she meant, that this is a good way to get some color or strong browning on the lamb, which is harder than with say ground beef.]Stir the lamb, black beans, and chickpeas into the rice. Simmer uncovered until heated through, about 5 minutes. Stir in the herbs, and serve.

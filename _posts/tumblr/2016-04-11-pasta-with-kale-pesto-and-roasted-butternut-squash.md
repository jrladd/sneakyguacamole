A tasty veggie dinner via NYT Recipes. 1 ½ pounds butternut squash½ cup extra virgin olive oil, more for drizzling¾ teaspoon kosher salt, more for squash Freshly ground black pepper1 small bunch (about ½ pound)lacinato kale, center ribs removed8 ounces pasta (penne rigate works well)⅓ cup toasted pine nuts2 large garlic cloves, roughly chopped Finely grated zest of 1 lemon Freshly squeezed lemon juice, to taste Grated Parmesan cheese, for servingPreheat oven to 400 degrees. Use a vegetable peeler to peel squash, then halve it lengthwise and scoop out seeds. Dice squash flesh into 1-inch pieces, place on a baking sheet, and toss with olive oil and season generously with salt and pepper. Spread pieces into an even layer, making sure there is space between them. Roast, stirring squash pieces once or twice, until golden brown and tender, about 30 minutes.Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil; have ready a bowl of ice water. Drop kale into boiling water and cook for 45 seconds. Use tongs or slotted spoon to transfer kale to ice water. Bring water in pot back to a boil, adding more if necessary so there is enough to cook pasta.Drain kale well, then wrap tightly in a dry kitchen towel and squeeze thoroughly to remove any excess moisture. Roughly chop leaves. When water in pot comes back to a boil, cook pasta according to package directions.In a food processor, pulse together kale, nuts, garlic, salt and lemon zest until mixture is smooth and salt has dissolved. With motor running, slowly drizzle in the oil until fully incorporated. Taste and add more salt dissolved in a little lemon juice, if necessary.Drain pasta, reserving a little cooking water. Toss pasta with kale pesto and some pasta cooking water if necessary to help it coat pasta. [Note: I didn’t need the total amount of pesto– maybe 2/3? So only add as much pesto as you need to the pasta, and then save the rest for another meal idea!] Add cheese, lemon juice and salt to taste. Serve topped with squash and more cheese.

<p>Have I mentioned lately that almost everything I try from the <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2007/07/summer-of-the-bats/">Smitten Kitchen</a> blog comes out perfectly? Often any problems are user errors on my part. This is also one of those goofy situations when I didn&rsquo;t take any pictures (except one random one during the process&hellip;see below, haha). I made the loaf as a gift for two people, then used the extra batter for muffins John and I took on a road trip. When I cook for others, I don&rsquo;t always remember to document it &hellip;</p>
<ul><li>3 eggs</li>
<li>1 cup olive or vegetable oil <i>[don&rsquo;t worry, it seems like a lot but it&rsquo;s OK!]</i></li>
<li>1 &frac34; cups sugar</li>
<li>2 cups grated zucchini</li>
<li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
<li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
<li>3 teaspoons cinnamon</li>
<li>1/8 teaspoon nutmeg</li>
<li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
<li>&frac12; teaspoon baking powder</li>
<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>&frac12; cup chopped walnuts or pecans (optional)</li>
<li>1 cup dried cranberries, raisins or chocolate chips or a combination thereof (optional)</li>
</ul><ol><li>
<p>Preheat oven to 350°F.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grease and flour two 8×4 inch loaf pans, liberally. Alternately, line 24 muffin cups with paper liners. <i>&ndash; I made a 9x13 loaf pan and about 10 or so muffins. </i></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a large bowl, beat the eggs with a whisk. Mix in oil and sugar, then zucchini and vanilla.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Combine flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, baking soda, baking powder and salt, as well as nuts, chocolate chips and/or dried fruit, if using.</p><img src="http://67.media.tumblr.com/e74383dd49caca43342ada7d5248c42b/tumblr_inline_nawcumHfGU1son4ik.jpg" alt="image"/>

</li>
<li>
<p>Stir this into the egg mixture. Divide the batter into prepared pans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bake loaves for 60 minutes, plus or minus ten, or until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean. Muffins will bake far more quickly, approximately 20 to 25 minutes. <i>[Just check every 10 minutes or so if you worry, as I do.]</i></p>
</li>
</ol>

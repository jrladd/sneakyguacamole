I made these for friendy times recently. While I tried to make quick homemade strawberry jelly, to make peanut butter and jelly cookies, I burned it REAL bad. Therefore, I substituted fig preserves (homemade by my mom) for some cookies and a chocolate filling for others. A new go-to cookie. Cookie recipe from Cooking Light, and I pulled the chocolate filling from Food Network. Cookies:2 cups all-purpose flour (about 9 ounces)¼ teaspoon salt¾ cup packed brown sugar2/3 cup granulated sugar½ cup chunky peanut butter¼ cup butter, softened 2 large eggs 1 teaspoon vanilla extractCooking spray Chocolate Filling:¾ cups semisweet chocolate chips2 tablespoons peanut butter2 tablespoons corn syrup1 tablespoon water1 teaspoon vanillaLightly spoon flour into dry measuring cups; level with a knife. Combine flour and salt, stirring well with a whisk; set aside.Place sugars, peanut butter, and butter in a large bowl; beat with a mixer at medium speed until well combined. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla. Gradually add flour mixture to sugar mixture, beating on low speed just until combined.Lightly coat hands with cooking spray. Shape dough into 36 balls (about 2 ½ teaspoons each) [I got more like 25 cookies out of my mixture]. Place balls 2 inches apart on baking sheets lined with parchment paper. Press thumb into center of each dough ball, leaving an indentation. Cover and chill 1 hour.Preheat oven to 350°.Uncover dough. Bake at 350° for 14 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove cookies from pans, and cool on a wire rack.While the cookies are baking, make your chocolate filling. To make the filling, in a bowl placed over a pot of  hot water, melt the chocolate then stir in the remaining ingredients. Cool 5 minutes then fill the centers of the cookies. Allow to slightly set, approximately 10 minutes.

<p>The answer is always cheese. This <a href="http://food52.com/recipes/15754-grilled-lemon-halloumi">Food 52 recipe</a> rocked&ndash;the marinade for the halloumi shined&ndash; and it&rsquo;s always good to have a good vegetarian dish in your back pocket. </p>

<ul><li>1 garlic clove, crushed</li>
<li>1 pinch sea salt flakes</li>
<li>1 teaspoon crushed peppercorns</li>
<li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
<li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
<li>2 unwaxed lemons, very thinly sliced</li>
<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
<li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
<li>1 block of halloumi cheese cut into slices about 1 &frac12; centimeters thick</li>
</ul><ol><li>You will need a hot oven. Preheat the oven to about 200°C (or 400°F). Slice one lemon thinly. Using a pestle and mortar pound the garlic, pinch of salt, herbs, and the peppercorns &ndash; add olive oil, honey and lemon juice from the other lemon. Rub the cheese and lemon slices with the mixture. <i>[I don&rsquo;t own a mortar and pestle, so I just minced the garlic and then mixed everything. I thought the consistency was fine.]</i><img src="http://66.media.tumblr.com/4e8b30fe945a4915a2aa42498e1d1222/tumblr_inline_n9npoiuf2S1son4ik.jpg" alt="image"/></li>
<li>Place it in an ovenproof dish, and let it color and caramelize uncovered for about 10 minutes. Remove and turn over to color the other side. <i>[For me, the cheese never caramelized as the recipe suggests. So to get that charred, grilled look and taste, I seared it under a broiler until a good color (maybe 5 minutes?). However, I don&rsquo;t know if broiling alone would heat the cheese all the way through, so I would still cook it at 400 degrees for a short time.]</i> Serve lemon side up, sprinkled with the remaining dressing and pan juices drizzled over.</li>

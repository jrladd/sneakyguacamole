A very easy/hands off pork ragu and my first attempt at homemade pappardelle pasta! Via Food52.2 to 2 ½ pounds boneless pork shoulder roast, tied with twine if there are any loose pieces1 small onion, chopped1 garlic clove, mincedSalt and pepper2 tablespoons olive oil1 small pat butter1 28-ounce can whole tomatoes, with juice1 cup red wine5 sprigs fresh thyme5 sprigs fresh oreganoSmall handful of fennel seeds1 tablespoon hot sauce, for smokiness (Andy used Trader Joe’s Hot Chili Sauce, but Sriracha and Tabasco both work great, too) [I used Louisiana Hot Sauce.]PappardelleFreshly grated ParmesanPreheat oven to 325° F. Liberally salt and pepper the pork roast. Add olive oil and butter to large Dutch oven and heat over medium-high until butter melts, but does not burn. Add pork roast to pan and brown on all sides, about 8 to 10 minutes in all.Add the onion and garlic and saute for 1 minute. Add tomatoes, wine, thyme, oregano, fennel, and hot sauce and bring to a boil. Cover, and put in oven.Braise for 3 to 4 hours, turning every hour or so. Add more liquid (water, wine, or tomato sauce) if needed. (The liquid should come to about 1/3 of the way up the pork.) Meat is done when it’s practically falling apart. Put on a cutting board and pull it apart with two forks, then add back to pot and stir (or shred right in the pot).Cook 1 to 2 pounds pasta according to package directions. [I made my pasta from scratch, but your favorite dry or fresh noodle would be great!] When it’s is ready, put into individual bowls and top with ragu and lots of Parm. Alternately, toss the pasta with the ragu and a bit of pasta cooking water, as needed, and top with Parm.

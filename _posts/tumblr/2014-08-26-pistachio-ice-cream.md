I have loved every ice cream recipe I have made from this cookbook from Bi-Rite Creamery book: Sweet Cream and Sugar Cones.
¾ cup raw shelled pistachios
¾ cup sugar
2 cups heavy cream
1 ¼ cup milk [they recommend 1 or 2 %, I just use whole milk because it’s what I have and I find it comes out well]
¼ tsp kosher salt
5 large egg yolks
Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
Spread the pistachios on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake until the nuts are just starting to brown and smell nutty, 5-6 minutes. Let cool completely.
Combine the cooled nuts and the sugar in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until finely ground (about the consistency of sand). Do not overprocess or the mixture will become oily and pasty.


Transfer the pistachio/sugar mixture to a heavy saucepan and stir in the cream, milk, and salt.
Put the pan over medium-high heat. When the mixture just begins to bubble around the edges, remove from the heat and cover the pan. Let steep for 15-20 minutes, or until a distinct pistachio flavor has infused into the mixture. (Taste it to monitor the progress.)


In a medium heatproof bowl, whisk the yolks to break them up. Set aside
Uncover the cream mixture and put the pan over medium-high heat. When the mixture approaches a bare simmer, reduce the heat to medium.
Carefully scoop out about ½ cup of the hot cream mixture and, whisking the eggs constantly, add the cream to the bowl with the egg yolks. Repeat, adding another ½ cup of the hot cream to the bowl with the yolks. Using a heatproof rubber spatula, stir the cream in the saucepan as you slowly pour the egg-and-cream mixture from the bowl into the pan.
Cook the mixture carefully over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until it is thickened, coats the back of a spatula, and holds a clear path when you run your finger across the spatula, 1-2 minutes longer.
Strain the base through a fine mesh strainer into a clean container. Set the container into an ice-water bath, wash your spatula, and use it to stir the base occasionally until it is cool. Remove the container from the ice-water bath, cover it with plastic wrap (I use a plastic tupperware container so I just cover it with its top), and refrigerate the base for at least two hours or overnight.
Freeze in your ice cream machine according to the manufacturer’s instructions. While the ice cream is churning, put the container you’ll use to store the ice cream into the freezer. Enjoy right away (soft serve style), or for a firmer ice cream, transfer to the chilled container and freeze for at least four hours.
I like to freeze my ice cream in freezer friendly Ball jars, which makes for perfect pint servings!


This is what it looks like straight out of the ice cream maker, with not further freezing.

<p>So&hellip; let me start this post by saying I burnt my thumb on grilled cheese. I&rsquo;m sitting here, blowing on my thumb, feeling excessively silly. </p>

<p>But, luckily, the thumb burning dinner was delicious! Now&rsquo;s the time to use those last summer tomatoes in this delicious soup, as I did with some I got from <a href="http://www.parkerstable.com/#!home/mainPage">Parker&rsquo;s Table</a>, which was selling local, St. Charles tomatoes. Like many others, I&rsquo;m of the belief that tomato soup cannot exist without grilled cheese. It just can&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s just smushed up tomato slush until there&rsquo;s a grilled cheese, then it becomes fantastically tasty soup.</p>

<p>So, without further ado, brought to you by <a href="http://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/summery-fresh-tomato-soup">Food &amp; Wine</a>, <a href="http://www.vegetariantimes.com/recipe/roasted-mushroom-and-gouda-grilled-cheese-sandwiches/">Vegetarian Times</a> magazine, and local produce!</p>


<p><b>Summery Fresh Tomato Soup</b></p>
<p>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</p>
<p>&frac34; cup minced sweet onion, such as Vidalia</p>
<p>1 &frac12; pounds tomatoes—peeled, seeded and chopped, with juices </p>
<p>[<i>The best way to peel tomatoes is to blanch them. Cut an X on the bottom of the tomatoes, then toss them in a pot of boiling water for about 30 secs to 1 min&ndash;any longer and the insides get furry/smushy. Then the skin easily peels off. Cut the tomato in half and cut out the core/stem and scoop out the seeds. This is also a great way to peel peaches, FYI.</i>]</p>
<p>1 teaspoon tomato paste</p>
<p>2 cups low-sodium chicken broth</p>
<p>1 basil sprig</p>
<p>Salt</p>
<p>Freshly ground pepper</p>

<p>In a large saucepan, melt the butter. Add the onion and cook over moderate heat, stirring, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes and their juices, along with the tomato paste and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes. Add the broth and basil and season with salt and pepper. Simmer until the tomatoes are broken down, about 15 minutes. Discard the basil and puree the soup until smooth. [<i>I think my immersion blender is the COOLEST kitchen tool I own, but you can also blend or food process your soup.</i>]<i> Also, Parmesan. Always Parmesan. On everything.</i></p>

<p><b>Roasted Mushroom and Gouda Grilled Cheese</b></p>
<p>[<i>I adjusted the recipe amounts to feed 2, instead of 4</i>.] </p>
<p>2 medium portobello mushrooms, stemmed </p>
<p>Prepared balsamic vinaigrette&ndash; like 1-2 tbsp 1 tbsp melted butter, divided</p>
<p> 2 Tbs. finely chopped parsley [<i>didn&rsquo;t use cause didn&rsquo;t have</i>] </p>
<p>3 cloves garlic, minced (1 Tbs.) [<i>didn&rsquo;t use cause did differently from recipe&ndash; see below</i>] </p>
<p>6 med/small slices whole-grain or country white bread </p>
<p>3 oz. shredded Gouda cheese [<i>I also used sliced cheddar because I didn&rsquo;t have much gouda</i>] </p>
<p>1 cup arugula [<i><i>I didn&rsquo;t have arugula, because mine had started getting wilty and I had made pesto with it. So I just spread pesto on one side of each of the sandwiches&ndash; ummm&hellip;YESSS]</i></i></p>

<p>1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Brush mushrooms with vinaigrette, place on baking sheet, and bake 15 minutes, turning once. Slice into &frac14;-inch-thick strips. [<i>I didn&rsquo;t know if this would make a difference, but you can really taste the balsamic, so this step is worth it.</i>]</p>
<p>2. Stir together butter, parsley, and garlic in bowl. Brush 4 bread slices with half of butter mixture, and set butter side down on baking sheet. [<i>Personally, I just put butter in the pan before putting the sandwich down, and apply more butter before flipping the sandwich. About a 1/3 a tbsp per sandwich.</i>]</p>

<p>3. Sprinkle Gouda [<i>or whatever cheese you want</i>] among bread slices on baking sheet. Top with mushroom strips, then arugula. Cover with remaining 4 bread slices. Brush sandwich tops with remaining butter mixture.</p>
<p>4. Heat large skillet or griddle over medium-low heat. Cook sandwiches in skillet 4 minutes, or until browned and crisp. Flip, and cook 3 minutes more, or until second side is browned.</p>

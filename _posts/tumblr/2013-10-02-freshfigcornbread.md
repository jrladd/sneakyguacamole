What’s better than cornbread? FRESH FIG CORNBREAD.
Brought to you by Food 52 and my utter love of figs.


Makes 1, 9-inch round cornbread
1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, just softened, and cut into chunks (plus extra for greasing the pan)
2/3 cups sugar
2 large eggs
1 cup coarse yellow cornmeal
1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cup milk or buttermilk [I just used what I had–milk]
8 ounces fresh figs, stemmed and halved
Heat your oven to 375F. Grease a 9-inch cast iron skillet or another heavy baking pan with butter.
In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream together the butter and the sugar until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in the eggs one at a time, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. Beat in the cornmeal.
In a small bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder and soda, and salt. Mixing on low speed, add the dry ingredients in 3 additions, alternating with the milk/buttermilk, and starting and ending with the dry ingredients.
Scrape the batter into the greased pan, then arrange the halved figs on top. Bake until the cornbread is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 40-50 minutes.
Serve warm, with spoonfuls of ricotta, if desired. The cornbread keeps, tightly covered, for several days. Just lightly toast slices in a toaster oven before serving and you’re good to go.



NOM.

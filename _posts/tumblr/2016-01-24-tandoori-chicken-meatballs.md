Would I call these tandoori? Nah. But nonetheless they were tastyyy. Via Healthy Delicious. 2 tablespoons olive oil1 pound ground chicken breast [We used ground chicken thighs for juicer meatballs, but breast would probably be healthier.]¼ cup unseasoned bread crumbs1 egg¼ cup cilantro, chopped½ lemon, juiced1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger1 teaspoon cumin1 teaspoon coriander1 teaspoon turmeric¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper¼ teaspoon saltHeat oven to 350F. Spread the oil onto the center of a rimmed baking sheet.In a large mixing bowl, combine the chicken, bread crumbs, egg, cilantro, lemon juice, and spices. Mix gently to combine. Form into 12 balls (a medium cookie scoop is perfect for this.) Arrange the meatballs on the baking sheet.Bake 10 minutes. Turn the meatballs over and bake another 10 minutes.Serve as you want: with lemon wedges, yogurt sauce, or like I did, over couscous.

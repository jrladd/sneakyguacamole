<ul><li>1 &frac12; pounds Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and cut into &frac34;-inch chunks</li>
<li>Kosher salt</li>
<li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
<li>1 &frac12; teaspoons curry powder</li>
<li>&frac14; teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
<li>1 15 -ounce can chickpeas, drained and rinsed</li>
<li>2 cups fried onions (one 2.8-ounce can)<i>&ndash; this is great if you have it but if you don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s still great without</i></li>
</ul><p><i>For the yogurt sauce, if you want one:</i></p>
<ul><li>&frac12; cup plain Greek yogurt</li>
<li>&frac14; cup chopped fresh cilantro, plus leaves for topping <i>(I used parsley instead because it&rsquo;s what I had)</i></li>
<li>2 tablespoons fresh lime juice<br/></li>
</ul><p>Put the potatoes, 2 teaspoons salt and enough cold water to cover in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook until the potatoes are almost tender, 3 to 6 minutes. Reserve 1 cup cooking water, then drain the potatoes.<br/><br/>Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the potatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 8 minutes. Stir in the curry powder and cayenne and cook, stirring, 30 seconds.<br/><br/>Add the chickpeas, 1 cup fried onions and &frac12; cup reserved cooking water; cook, mashing the potatoes with a spoon, until heated through, about 3 minutes. Add more cooking water, if needed. Season with salt.<br/><br/>Mix the yogurt, chopped cilantro, lime juice and 2 tablespoons water in a bowl. Divide the potato-chickpea mixture among bowls. Top with the yogurt sauce &amp; the remaining 1 cup fried onions.<br/></p>

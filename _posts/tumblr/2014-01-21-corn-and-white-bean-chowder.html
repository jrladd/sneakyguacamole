<p>Wow. Much creamy. So winter. Wow.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.acouplecooks.com/2013/09/corn-white-bean-chowder/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+ACoupleCooks+%28A+Couple+Cooks%29">A Couple of Cooks</a> for this recipe!</p>
<ul><li>1 yellow onion</li>
<li>½ red bell pepper</li>
<li>3 carrots</li>
<li>2 cloves garlic</li>
<li>1 pound red skinned potatoes</li>
<li>6 ears corn <i>(or frozen corn&hellip;I eyeballed it but I would guess about 2-4 cups based on your preference)</i></li>
<li>1 can white beans</li>
<li>A few sprigs fresh thyme</li>
<li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
<li>1 bay leaf</li>
<li>6 cups milk</li>
<li>¼ cup cornmeal or masa <i>(AWESOME addition to this recipe I never would have thought of)</i></li>
<li>2 tsp kosher salt</li>
<li>Fresh ground pepper</li>
</ul><p>1. Dice the yellow onion and half of a red pepper. Peel and dice three carrots. Mince two cloves garlic. Dice the potatoes. Cut the corn off the cob (if possible, use a bundt pan: place the corn cob in the center ring and cut the corn down into the pan). Save the cobs. Drain and rinse the white beans; set aside. Remove the leaves of thyme and set aside.</p>
<p>2. In a large pot, melt 2 tablespoons butter. Saute the onion and bay leaf 4 minutes, until soft. Add the carrots, red pepper, and garlic, and saute for 4 minutes. Add corn, corn cobs, potatoes, and 6 cups milk. Bring to a boil. Then simmer, covered, for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.</p>
<p>3. Remove the corn cobs and bay leaf. In a small bowl, mix cornmeal or masa with ¼ cup (or a bit more) water, then add to pot. Add 2 teaspoons kosher salt, white beans, and fresh thyme. Heat through for about 5 to 10 minutes, until the vegetables are tender and the soup is thickened a bit (mash down lumps of cornmeal if any occur).</p>
<p><i>This really is one of the best, easy to make corn chowders I&rsquo;ve had. </i></p>
<p><b>MMmmmmmm.</b></p>

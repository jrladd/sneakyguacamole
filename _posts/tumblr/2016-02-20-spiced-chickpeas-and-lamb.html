<p>This was a good, if not great, recipe. It could have used a good yogurt sauce (since it was quite spicy!). But, I appreciated how easy it was.

Add the onion and &frac12; tsp salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until just tender, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the bell pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.<br/></li><li>Add the rice, cumin, coriander, and cayenne and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the water and bring to a boil. Then cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the rice is just tender, about 30 minutes. [<i>Fair warning, I don’t know if it was because of the shape of my dutch oven or what, but cooking the rice took more like 50 minutes-1 hr.</i>]</li><li>Meanwhile, heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Add the lamb and press it into the pan in a single layer. Sprinkle with 1 tsp salt and &frac12; tsp pepper. Just let it sit to get some color, about 10 minutes. When it’s really browned on the bottom, stir it around to make sure it’s all cooked. Drain in a colander. [<i>I thought this instruction was strange: why not just brown the meat normally? But I tried it and I see what she meant, that this is a good way to get some color or strong browning on the lamb, which is harder than with say ground beef.</i>]</li><li>Stir the lamb, black beans, and chickpeas into the rice. Simmer uncovered until heated through, about 5 minutes. Stir in the herbs, and serve.</li></ol>

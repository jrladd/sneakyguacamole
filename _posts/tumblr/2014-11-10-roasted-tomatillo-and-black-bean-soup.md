I had never used a tomatillo before, and when I saw them at the farmer’s market, and the stand owner offered me a deal, I couldn’t refuse!


While this wasn’t my favorite soup, I liked it. It was sort of a salsa soup. A lot of heat, but it didn’t have a ton of depth. However, I’d eat it again! Recipe from A Couple Cooks.
12 small tomatillos
2 red onions
2 jalapeno peppers
3 garlic cloves
Olive oil
Kosher salt
1 quart vegetable broth
1 can beans
1 can hominy (I LOVE the texture of hominy.)
3 sprigs cilantro + more for garnish
8 radishes (optional)
3 green onions (optional)
Kosher salt
Fresh ground pepper
One lime
Preheat an oven to 450F.
Roughly chop 12 small tomatillos, 2 red onions, and 2 jalapeno peppers (remove the seeds). Cut 3 garlic cloves into quarters.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the chopped veggies, peppers, and garlic on the sheet and drizzle with enough olive oil to coat. Sprinkle with kosher salt. Roast until soft and slightly browned, about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Use this time to drain and rinse the hominy and black beans. Also, prepare the garnishes: thinly slice the radishes and green onions, and chop the cilantro.
Add the roasted vegetables to a pot. Using an immersion blender, puree with 1 quart vegetable broth (alternatively, use a blender).
Add 3 sprigs of cilantro, hominy and black beans. Bring the mixture to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for about 15 minutes. Season with kosher salt.
Remove the cilantro sprigs. Pour into bowls, and garnish with green onions, radishes, cilantro, and fresh-squeezed lime juice.

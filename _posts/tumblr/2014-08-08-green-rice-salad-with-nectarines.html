<p>Lovely, fresh side (in which I subbed orzo for rice) from <a href="http://www.bonappetempt.com/2014/07/green-rice-salad-with-nectarines-and.html">Bon Appetempt</a>.</p>

<ul><li>
1 cup brown basmati rice
</li>
<li>
1 2/3 cups water, plus 2 to 3 tablespoons more for sauce
</li>
<li>
&frac34; cup coarsely chopped fresh cilantro
</li>
<li>
&frac12; cup loosely packed fresh flat-leaf parsley
</li>
<li>
1 small jalapeño, seeded and chopped
</li>
<li>
zest and juice of 1 small lime
</li>
<li>
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
</li>
<li>2 small ears of corn</li>
<li>
salt
</li>
<li>
2 medium-ripe nectarines, pitted and thinly sliced lengthwise
</li>
<li>
&frac34; cup crumbled soft goat cheese
</li>
</ul><ol><li>
In a saucepan, combine the rice and water, cover, and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer, covered, until the liquid has been absorbed and the rice is tender, about 30 minutes. Let the rice stand for a few minutes, then fluff. Set aside to cool to room temperature. <i>[If you choose orzo, as I did, just follow the instructions on the pasta package.]</i>
</li>
<li>
<i>To grill the corn, lightly oil both ears of corn and place on a grill. Turn every few minutes until golden and cooked through (about 10 minutes or so). Leave longer if you want blackened in spots. You can tell if it&rsquo;s ready because the corn gets more brightly yellow, as green beans or broccoli become more green as you steam them.</i>
</li>
<li>
Transfer to plate and set aside until cool enough handle. Using a large sharp knife, cut the kernels from the cob to yield about 1 cup. If you have more than this, save it for another use. Transfer the kernels to bowl and toss with pinch of salt and a squeeze of lime. Set aside. <i>[Hint to cut corn off the cob, put a smaller bowl opening down in a larger bowl. Place the cob on top of the overturned bowl and cut the kernels off. The second bowl will keep the kernels from flying off.]</i>
</li>
<li>
Transfer the rice to large bowl. In a blender, combine the cilantro, parsley, jalapeño, lime zest and juice, olive oil, pinch of salt, and 1 tablespoon water. Blend until smooth. Add up to 2 more tablespoons of water to thin the sauce if it&rsquo;s too thick. Spoon the mixture over the rice, scraping any remaining sauce out of the blender with a spatula, and mix until the rice is evenly coated. 
</li>
<li>
To finish, add the corn and additional parsley and cilantro to the rice. Toss to combine. Transfer the rice to a serving platter. Sprinkle the nectarines and cheese over the rice in even layers. Garnish with additional parsley and cilantro. <i>[Note: since I lacked heat in the recipe, not having any jalapeños to add, I added capers at the end to give a saltier taste.]</i> (Best served immediately. Can be made up to a day in advance; bring to room temperature before serving.)

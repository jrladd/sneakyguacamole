I’m always suspicious of sides. I’m a one pot dinner kind of a person. However, I had this beautiful squash that I grew in my garden and I wanted to cook it respectfully. And this recipe treated the squash well. Via Cooking Light. 1 (14-ounce) can fat-free, less-sodium chicken broth, divided [This is about 1 ¾ cups of broth]¾ cup uncooked couscousCooking spray 2 cups sliced yellow squash (about 2 small) ½ cup sliced green onions 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano1 garlic clove, minced¼ cup (1 ounce) shredded fontina cheese [I used cheddar–also good!]¼ cup (1 ounce) grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese¼ cup egg substitute [I substituted one egg for the egg substitute–puns!]¼ teaspoon salt¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Preheat oven to 400°.Bring 1 cup chicken broth to a boil in a medium saucepan; gradually stir in uncooked couscous. Remove from heat; cover and let stand 5 minutes. Fluff couscous with a fork. [I like a little more seasoning and umph to my couscous, so I put a little olive oil in the pot, heat it up, then added a small sliced carrot, ½ an onion, and some rosemary. Cooked it till the veggies were soft– 5-8 minutes– then added the cup of broth, brought it to a boil, added the couscous, and took it off heat.]Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Coat pan with cooking spray. Add squash, onions, basil, oregano, and garlic; sauté 3 minutes or until squash is tender. Set aside.Combine fontina and Parmigiano-Reggiano; set aside. Combine couscous, squash mixture, and half of cheese mixture in a large bowl; stir in remaining chicken broth, egg substitute, salt, and pepper. Spoon mixture into an 8 x 8-inch baking dish lightly coated with cooking spray. Top with remaining cheese mixture. Bake at 400° for 35 minutes or until golden. Serve warm.

<p>I have loved every ice cream recipe I have made from this cookbook from Bi-Rite Creamery book: <i><a href="http://biritecreamery.com/book">Sweet Cream and Sugar Cones</a>.</i></p>
<ul><li>&frac34; cup raw shelled pistachios</li>
<li>&frac34; cup sugar</li>
<li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
<li>1 &frac14; cup milk <i>[they recommend 1 or 2 %, I just use whole milk because it&rsquo;s what I have and I find it comes out well]</i></li>
<li>&frac14; tsp kosher salt</li>
<li>5 large egg yolks</li>
</ul><ol><li>Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
<li>Spread the pistachios on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake until the nuts are just starting to brown and smell nutty, 5-6 minutes. Let cool completely.</li>
<li>Combine the cooled nuts and the sugar in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until finely ground (about the consistency of sand). Do not overprocess or the mixture will become oily and pasty.<img src="http://66.media.tumblr.com/fc0fe115e6d6179a8648c83f2cc53099/tumblr_inline_nawb85FUhs1son4ik.jpg" alt="image"/><img src="http://67.media.tumblr.com/1aea423c2f55f1e7ea4fb205cbc981e5/tumblr_inline_nawb8jPRni1son4ik.jpg" alt="image"/><p></p>

<li>Transfer the pistachio/sugar mixture to a heavy saucepan and stir in the cream, milk, and salt.</li>
<li>Put the pan over medium-high heat. When the mixture just begins to bubble around the edges, remove from the heat and cover the pan. Let steep for 15-20 minutes, or until a distinct pistachio flavor has infused into the mixture. (Taste it to monitor the progress.)<img src="http://67.media.tumblr.com/80fc216e731e529646009b736d5b18da/tumblr_inline_nawbcehWlE1son4ik.jpg" alt="image"/></li>
<li>

In a medium heatproof bowl, whisk the yolks to break them up. Set aside</li>
<li>Uncover the cream mixture and put the pan over medium-high heat. When the mixture approaches a bare simmer, reduce the heat to medium.</li>
<li>Carefully scoop out about &frac12; cup of the hot cream mixture and, whisking the eggs constantly, add the cream to the bowl with the egg yolks. Repeat, adding another &frac12; cup of the hot cream to the bowl with the yolks. Using a heatproof rubber spatula, stir the cream in the saucepan as you slowly pour the egg-and-cream mixture from the bowl into the pan.</li>
<li>Cook the mixture carefully over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until it is thickened, coats the back of a spatula, and holds a clear path when you run your finger across the spatula, 1-2 minutes longer.</li>
<li>Strain the base through a fine mesh strainer into a clean container. Set the container into an ice-water bath, wash your spatula, and use it to stir the base occasionally until it is cool. Remove the container from the ice-water bath, cover it with plastic wrap <i>(I use a plastic tupperware container so I just cover it with its top)</i>, and refrigerate the base for at least two hours or overnight.<img src="http://66.media.tumblr.com/f4e62548a5c37291953d22c7cf9a59a3/tumblr_inline_nawbonZSng1son4ik.jpg" alt="image"/></li>
<li>Freeze in your ice cream machine according to the manufacturer&rsquo;s instructions. While the ice cream is churning, put the container you&rsquo;ll use to store the ice cream into the freezer. Enjoy right away (<i>soft serve style</i>), or for a firmer ice cream, transfer to the chilled container and freeze for at least four hours.</li>
</ol><p>I like to freeze my ice cream in freezer friendly Ball jars, which makes for perfect pint servings!</p>

<p>This is what it looks like straight out of the ice cream maker, with not further freezing.Â </p>

<p>With football season kicked off, you KNOW there needs be chicken wings. I used full sized chicken wings bought at the farmers market and used this (hilarious and slightly absurd but helpful) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTWOHVavdwg">video</a> to help me break them up into traditional buffalo wing sizes. Via <a href="http://iamafoodblog.com/crispy-oven-sriracha-buffalo-wings-recipe/">i am a food blog</a>.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="2223" data-orig-width="2432"><img src="http://66.media.tumblr.com/431eaef5da260a63b3c12b52e628606a/tumblr_inline_nuue8xwTjX1son4ik_540.jpg" data-orig-height="2223" data-orig-width="2432"/></figure><ul><li>3 &frac12; pounds chicken wings</li><li>2 tablespoons baking powder</li><li>&frac34; teaspoon salt</li><li>1 recipe wing sauce (below)</li></ul><p>Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and preheat to 250°F. Set a wire rack into an foil lined rimmed baking sheet. Pat the wings dry with paper towels and place into a large ziplock bag. Combine the baking powder and salt and add to the bag. Seal and toss to evenly coat.</p><p>Arrange the wings, skin side up, in a single layer on the rack. Bake on the lower rack for 30 minutes and then move the wings to the upper rack. Increase the temperature to 425°F and roast until golden brown and crispy, 40-50 minutes. Rotate the sheet halfway through baking. Remove from the oven and let stand for 5 minutes before transferring to a large bowl and tossing with wing sauce. Enjoy hot.</p><p>SRIRACHA BUFFALO WING SAUCE RECIPE slightly adapted from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1936493861/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1936493861&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=iamafoodblog-20&amp;linkId=V2SELTDCYP3GKVPS">Cook’s Illustrated Meat Book</a><br/>makes about &frac34; cup</p><ul><li>&frac12; cup sriracha </li><li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted </li><li>2 tablespoon molasses </li></ul><p>Stir together the ingredients in a bowl until throughly mixed.</p><p>Note: The key to these crispy oven baked wings is the baking power and salt. The salt breaks down the proteins in the skin and the baking powder helps with browning. Starting the wings at a low temperature renders out the fat without overcooking and finishing at a higher temperature crisps and browns the skin.</p>

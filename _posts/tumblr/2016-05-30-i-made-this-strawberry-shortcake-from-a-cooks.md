I made this strawberry shortcake from a Cook’s Illustrated recipe; while it was good, I didn’t think it was fantastic, so no need to post the recipe. The cake ended up a bit too try, I think–which may be more my fault than the recipe’s fault! Nonetheless, I spent some time on it, and it was pretty, so here it is! Before serving, I dusted the cake with powdered sugar for a polished look.

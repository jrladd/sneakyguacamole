Ina Garten is my homegirl. I love her recipes. They always come out just right (unlike my experience with Martha Stewart recipes …) and this soup is one of my all time favorites. Sometimes the Contessa gets flak for her recipes having too many (or too expensive) recipes. However, this recipe defies those criticisms.

2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 tablespoon good olive oil
2 cups chopped yellow onions (2 onions)
1 (15 - ounce) can pumpkin puree (not pumpkin pie filling)
1 ½ pounds butternut squash, peeled and cut in chunks
3 cups homemade chicken stock or canned broth
2 teaspoons kosher salt
½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 cup half - and - half
Heat the butter and oil in a heavy - bottomed stockpot, add the onions, and cook over medium - low heat for 10 minutes, or until translucent. 
Add the pumpkin puree, butternut squash, chicken stock, salt, and pepper. Cover and simmer over medium - low heat for about 20 minutes, until the butternut squash is very tender. 
Process the mixture through the medium blade of a food mill. (I use my immersion blender to make the soup smooth.) Return to the pot, add the half - and - half, and heat slowly. If the soup needs more flavor, add another teaspoon of salt. 
Serve hot with garnishes (like parmesan and croutons), if desired.

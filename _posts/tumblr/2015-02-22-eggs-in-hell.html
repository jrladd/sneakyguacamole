My fella tells me this Mario Batalli recipe is similar to a dish in his Italian American family. I served these eggs cooked in a spicy tomato sauce over cheesy grits. Mmmm. Via <a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/the-chew/recipes/Mario-Batali-Eggs-Hell">The Chew</a>. </p><ul><li>4 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li><li>1 medium onion coarsely chopped</li><li>6 cloves garlic thinly sliced</li><li>4 jalapeño peppers seeded and cut into &frac14; inch dice</li><li>1 teaspoon hot chile flakes</li><li>3 cup <a href="http://beta.abc.go.com/shows/the-chew/recipes/Basic-Tomato-Sauce-Mario-Batali">basic tomato sauce</a></li><li>8 large eggs</li><li>&frac14; grated Parmigiano Reggiano or Pecorino</li><li>Shredded basil</li><li>Salt and pepper</li></ul><ol><li>Place a skillet, preferably cast iron, on the grill over medium-high heat. </li><li>Add the oil and heat until just smoking.Add the chopped onion, garlic, jalapeños and chile flakes and cook until softened and light brown, about 7 minutes.</li><li>Add the tomato sauce and bring to a boil. Immediately lower the heat to a simmer and carefully crack the eggs one by one into the tomato sauce. Season with salt and pepper.  </li><li>Cook until as set as desired. I like it when the whites set but the yolks are still quite runny, about 5-6 minutes. [<i>Remember that the eggs will continue to cook in the tomato sauce, even once you take the pan off heat. Therefore, unless dishing out immediately, don&rsquo;t cook your eggs as much as you&rsquo;d like, since it will cook more in the sauce.</i>]</li><li>Remove the pan from the heat and sprinkle with cheese and some shredded basil. Allow to cool 3-4 minutes.  Garnish with basil and serve.</li></ol>

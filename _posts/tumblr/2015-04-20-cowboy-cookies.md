I make this cookie all the time, and can never seem to remember to take pictures! This time I accidentally set my parchment paper on fire, so I remembered. Cowboy cookies, or kitchen sink cookies, are great because they’ve got everything– chocolate, nuts, coconuts, even fruit sometimes. Strangely, they use crisco instead of butter as their fat. They’re just delicious, and usually my go-to cookie– via Food Network. 1 cup shortening (recommended: Crisco)1 cup granulated sugar1 cup brown sugar2 eggs1 teaspoon vanilla extract2 cups all-purpose flour1 teaspoon baking soda½ teaspoon salt½ teaspoon baking powder2 cups rolled oats½ cup chopped pecans1 (6-ounce) package chocolate chips½ cup shredded coconutPreheat oven to 350 degrees F.In a large bowl, with an electric mixer, cream the shortening, granulated sugar, and brown sugar. Add eggs and the vanilla and beat until well blended. Stir in the flour, baking soda, salt, and baking powder. Add oats, nuts, chocolate chips and coconut, mix until combined. Spoon cookie mixture onto greased foil lined cookie sheet. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes. [Mine have been taking more like 12-13 minutes.] Transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool.

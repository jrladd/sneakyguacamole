<p>Fall is prime soup time. Soups are easy, usually require only one bowl (and thus less clean up), and can be frozen for later eating; therefore, I make a lot of soups. YAY soups!</p>
<p>This post is brought to you by the amazing food blog, <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2007/10/sweet-potato-and-sausage-soup/">Smitten Kitchen</a>, and my effusive feelings for soup.</p>
<p><b>Sweet Potato and Sausage Soup</b></p>
<p>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided<br/>1 10- to 11-ounce fully cooked smoked Portuguese linguica sausage or chorizo sausage, cut crosswise into &frac14;-inch-thick slices (Spanish chorizo can be substituted) (<i>I just used hot chorizo, but really any sausage would rock</i>.)<br/>2 medium onions, chopped<br/>2 large garlic cloves, minced<br/>2 pounds sweet potatoes (yams; about 2 large), peeled, quartered lengthwise, cut crosswise into &frac14;-inch-thick slices<br/>1 pound white-skinned potatoes, peeled, halved lengthwise, cut crosswise into &frac14;-inch-thick slices (<i>just cut up the potatoes however you want!</i>)<br/>6 cups chicken broth (low sodium or regular)<br/>1 9-ounce bag fresh spinach (<i>I used kale because that was the green I had&ndash; swiss chard, kale, or any hearty leafy green would also work as well as spinach</i>)</p>

<p>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add sausage; cook until brown, stirring often, about 8 minutes. Transfer sausage to paper towels to drain. (I poured off some of the oil in the pot at this point, but the original recipe doesnâ€™t think this is needed.) Add onions and garlic to pot and cook until translucent, stirring often, about 5 minutes. Add all potatoes and cook until beginning to soften, stirring often, about 12 minutes. Add broth; bring to boil, scraping up browned bits. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until potatoes are soft, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes. Using potato masher (<i>or a fork</i>), mash some of potatoes in pot. Add browned sausage to soup. Stir in spinach (<i>or whatever green</i>) and simmer just until wilted, about 5 minutes. Stir in remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Season with salt and pepper. Divide among bowls and serve.</p>
<p>Smitten Kitchen&rsquo;s other options to consider: Kielbasa (suggested by commenter Wendy) instead of chorizo/linguica, adding a can or two of drained white beans or using more spinach. I love spinach wilted in soups and could have used even more.</p>

<p><b>YUM!</b></p>

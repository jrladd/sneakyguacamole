<p>So, a Cajun + an Italian = a ridiculously delicious household. John and I both come from food-centric cultures and love to share our recipes with each other. For me, cooking and sharing food is the way I express that I care for someone, so I think it&rsquo;s neat and special when I make one of John&rsquo;s family&rsquo;s recipes. Or maybe I&rsquo;m just silly and squishy inside. :P</p>
<p>This recipe is brought to you by John&rsquo;s tiny 4'8&quot; Brooklyn/Long Island Italian American grandma and weeknight cooking!</p><img src="http://66.media.tumblr.com/5c903be07586b1f9ff5d060d3d6107b4/tumblr_inline_mwaf9umnWx1son4ik.jpg" alt="image"/>

<p>This recipe is pieced together from John&rsquo;s childhood, so we just kind of wing it a little. It&rsquo;s perfect because you don&rsquo;t need much to make it and it&rsquo;s hard to mess it up.</p>

<ul><li>Bell peppers (this time, I made 5)</li>
<li>Eggs (generally, about twice as many eggs as peppers, so about 10 eggs in this case)</li>
<li>Bread crumbs (we use flavored ones so we don&rsquo;t have to use more herbs, but whatever you have works&ndash; if you&rsquo;re adding herbs, garlic and oregano would be good)</li>
<li>Parmesan cheese (in equal amounts with the bread crumbs, maybe a &frac12;-&frac34; cup of each?)</li>
<li>tomato sauce (optional but delish)</li>
</ul><p>Oven at 350 degrees. Get a casserole dish and add some tomato sauce to the bottom so your peppers don&rsquo;t stick to your dish. Don&rsquo;t want tomato sauce? Just put them on a baking sheet that you&rsquo;ve covered with a lightly greased aluminum foil sheet.</p>
<p>Cut the tops off your peppers and empty them out of seeds, etc and place them in the tomato sauce-d casserole dish.</p>
<p>Make your mixture. Crack your eggs in a medium bowl, scramble them a bit, and add salt and pepper to your liking. Add your bread crumbs and parmesan and mix. You&rsquo;re looking for a pourable consistency, with enough bread crumbs to soak up the eggs so the mixture isn&rsquo;t just liquid-y and eggy. Pour this mixture into the empty peppers.</p>
<p>Pop the peppers in the oven. Fact: this always takes longer to cook than you think. I would give it at least 30-45 minutes. Check every so often with a toothpick or fork. When you stab the pepper filling, your toothpick should come out dry. You&rsquo;re shooting for a kind of fluffy, souffle consistency for your egg filling.Â </p>
<p>Once it&rsquo;s finished, garnish with tomato sauce and parmesan as you wish.</p>

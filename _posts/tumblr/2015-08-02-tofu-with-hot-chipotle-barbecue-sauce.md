Great weeknight grilling option! Via NYT. I served it over a rice mixture with black beans, peppers, mango, and cheese. 1 tablespoon adobo sauce from canned chipotles [I always chop & freeze leftovers from the can into ice cube molds, then store in a plastic bag.]2 teaspoons light or dark brown sugar Salt to taste¼ cup ketchup2 tablespoons unrefined peanut oil or extra virgin olive oil1 teaspoon soy sauce1 to 2 tablespoons water (more to taste)Mix together all of the ingredients. [I marinate the tofu for 15-20 minutes in the marinade before putting it on the grill, to enhance the flavor. Then I grilled the pieces on medium high heat for 2-4 minutes on each side, till grill marks appeared.] Brush [remaining marinade] on seared or grilled tofu as soon as it comes off the heat, or onto uncooked slices.

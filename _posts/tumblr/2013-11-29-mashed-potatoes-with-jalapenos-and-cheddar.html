<p>Mmmmm&hellip;</p>
<p>This recipe is brought to you by <a href="http://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/mashed-potatoes-with-jalapeno-and-cheddar">Food &amp; Wine</a>.</p>
<p>For 2 person Thanksgiving, I cut this in half and had lots of leftovers. In order to prepare ahead, I peeled and cut up the potatoes the day before. The morning of Thanksgiving, the potatoes looked a little browned, but still tasted delicious, FYI.</p>

<ul><li>4 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
<li>Kosher salt</li>
<li>1 &frac12; sticks unsalted butter</li>
<li>1 &frac14; cups whole milk</li>
<li>&frac12; pound sharp white cheddar cheese, shredded (2 2/3 cups)</li>
<li>1 cup mayonnaise</li>
<li>1 large jalapeño—stemmed, seeded and minced</li>
<li>Freshly ground white pepper <i>(or just regular pepper&hellip;)</i></li>
</ul><ol><li>In a large saucepan, cover the potatoes with water and bring to a boil. Add a generous pinch of salt and simmer over moderate heat until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain the potatoes in a colander, shaking off any excess water.</li>
<li>In the same saucepan, melt the butter in the milk over moderately low heat. Remove from the heat and stir in the cheese. Press the potatoes through a ricer into the pot and mix well. <i>I didn&rsquo;t have a ricer, and prefer chunkier mashed potatoes, so I just mashed them and then threw them in the pot.</i> Fold in the mayonnaise and jalapeño and season with salt and white pepper. Serve right away.</li>
<li>MAKE AHEAD If you’re not serving the potatoes right away, let them cool, then transfer to a bowl or large resealable plastic bag and refrigerate for up to 3 days. Rewarm the potatoes in the microwave in 2-minute intervals, stirring each time, until hot.</li>
</ol><p><b>YUM.</b></p>

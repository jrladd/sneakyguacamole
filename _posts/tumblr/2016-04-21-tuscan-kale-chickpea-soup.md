Add onion, carrot, and celery; sauté until softened, about 5 minutes.Add garlic, chili flakes, thyme, and a sprinkling of salt, and pepper; sauté until fragrant, about a minute.Add chickpeas and kale; stir to wilt. Add stock; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and add couscous [if adding]; simmer, partially covered, until tender, about 10 minutes [minimum]. [I also immersion blended my soup a bit to give it some texture.]*This would also be delicious with other extras. For example, adding fennel to the mix!

<p>Ok, I should start by saying&ndash; this dish was WAY to salty. I’ve always preferred salty to sweet, but this was even too salty for me! However, it did taste good, and I love all the recipe’s parts&ndash;olives, capers. cheese&ndash; so I recommend it, but I would cut all the salty ingredients by HALF at least. Taste as you go and see.

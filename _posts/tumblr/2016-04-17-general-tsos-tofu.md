Holy moly, this was a fantastic substitute for delivery Asian food, via Vegetarian Times. Crispy Tofu1 16-oz. pkg. firm tofu, drained2 tsp. low-sodium soy sauce2 tsp. rice vinegar1 tsp. mirin (rice wine)1 tsp. vegetable oil½ tsp. minced garlic½ tsp. grated fresh ginger1 Tbs. cornstarchSauce½ cup low-sodium vegetable broth2 Tbs. sugar1 ½ Tbs. low-sodium soy sauce4 tsp. mirin (rice wine)2 tsp. rice vinegar2 tsp. sesame oil2 tsp. cornstarch1 ½ tsp. tomato paste½ tsp. sambal oelek chile paste, optional2 tsp. vegetable oil4 green onions, green parts chopped (⅓ cup)1 clove garlic, minced (1 tsp.)½ tsp. grated fresh ginger1. To make Crispy Tofu: Cut tofu block into two broad slabs. Wrap tofu slabs in paper towels, and place between two cutting boards. Weight top cutting board with soup cans, and press 30 minutes. Unwrap tofu, and cut into 1-inch cubes. [Note: I always freeze my tofu because it changes the texture of the tofu and makes it meatier. So I do these steps but cut it into 1 inch slices, and freeze–then defrost and cut the slices into 1 inch cubes.]2. Combine soy sauce, vinegar, mirin, oil, garlic, and ginger in resealable container. Add tofu, and toss to coat. Marinate 30 minutes, or overnight. (Tofu should absorb all liquid.)3. Preheat oven to 350°F, and coat baking sheet with cooking spray. Sift cornstarch over tofu, and turn to coat evenly. Spread tofu on baking sheet. Bake 30 to 40 minutes, or until firm and crispy, turning several times to brown all sides.4. To make Sauce: Whisk together broth, sugar, soy sauce, mirin, vinegar, sesame oil, cornstarch, tomato paste, and sambal oelek (if using) in small bowl. Set aside.5. Heat vegetable oil in wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Add green onions, garlic, and ginger, and stir-fry 1 minute. Add broth mixture, and cook 1 minute, or until thickened. Stir in Tofu. Serve with steamed broccoli and rice. [I steam my broccoli in the sauce with the tofu, just to add extra flavor to the broccoli, then I serve over rice!]

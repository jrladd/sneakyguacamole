<p>This recipe seemed as good as any to break in my new food processor I got for Christmas. Aren&rsquo;t neat kitchen toys the best? Well, no worries though, a box grater will work just fine as well. But if you want to be entertained, look further down in this tumblr to see my reaction to grating the potatoes in my food processor; you will not be disappointed. This recipe is brought to you by <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2008/12/potato-pancakes-even-better/">Smitten Kitchen</a> and Santa (cough cough Ray and Karen)!</p>

<ul><li>1 large baking potato (1 pound), peeled</li>
<li>1 small onion (4 ounces), peeled</li>
<li>&frac14; cup all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>&frac14; teaspoon freshly ground pepper</li>
<li>Peanut oil, for frying <i>(I used olive oil)</i></li>
</ul><p>In a food processor or on a box grater, coarsely shred the potato and onion. For longer strands, lay the potato sideways in the chute of your food processor. Transfer to a colander or wrap in a cheesecloth sling, and squeeze as dry as possible. Let stand for 2 minutes, then squeeze dry again. </p>
<p>In a large bowl, whisk the flour, egg, salt and pepper together. Stir in the potato onion mixture until all pieces are evenly coated.</p>
<p>In a medium skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil until shimmering. Drop packed teaspoons of the potato mixture into the skillet and flatten them with the back of a spoon. <i>I made about 4 bigger, pancake sized latkes from this recipe.</i> Cook the latkes over moderately high heat until the edges are golden, about 1 &frac12; minutes; flip and cook until golden on the bottom, about 1 minute. Drain on paper towels. Repeat with the remaining potato mixture, adding more oil to the skillet as needed.</p>
<p><i>John and I topped one latke each with a fried egg and one latke each with applesauce. Both delicious, just depending on your mood!</i></p>
<p>Do ahead: Latkes are a do-ahead-er’s dream. You can also keep latkes warm in the oven for an hour or more, if you’re waiting for stragglers to arrive. Cooked, they keep well in the fridge for a day or two, or in the freezer, well wrapped, for up to two weeks. Reheat them in a single layer on a cookie sheet in a 400 degree oven until they’re crisp again. Bonus: If you undercooked them a bit or didn’t get the browning on them you’d hoped for, you can compensate for this in the oven.</p>
<p><b>YUM.</b></p>

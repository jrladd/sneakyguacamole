<p>I&rsquo;m real goofy and cooked this forever ago and never posted it! <a href="http://www.saucemagazine.com/a/1894">This recipe</a> comes from one of our fantastic local food magazines, Sauce, and is from a fantastic local Italian restaurant I brought my family too&ndash; Trattoria Marcella. St Louis has a wonderful, authentic Italian neighborhood, which means you can get great ingredients there! Life is good.</p>

Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re the bomb. BUT . .  I didn&rsquo;t do them that day. Try them out and tell me, yes? The recipe I&rsquo;ve linked to has the full recipe, but since I used frozen (and delish) ones I got from my CSA with local meat and whatnot, I won&rsquo;t post it here.</i><p></p>
<p><b>San Marzano Tomato Sauce </b><br/>Extra-virgin olive oil <br/>1 medium yellow onion, diced <br/>1 large carrot, peeled and diced <br/>1½ Tbsp. minced garlic <br/>4 16-oz. cans whole San Marzano tomatoes <br/>1½ Tbsp. chopped fresh basil <br/>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste <br/><br/></p>
<ol><li>Coat a medium pot with extra-virgin olive oil over medium heat. Saute the onion, carrot and garlic until soft. </li>
<li>Meanwhile, add the tomatoes to a large bowl and crush with your hands. </li>
<li>Add the crushed tomatoes, basil and salt and pepper to the pot with the sauteed vegetables. Stir to combine. Cook 30 minutes over medium heat. </li>

<ul><li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
<li>Kosher salt</li>
<li>1 cup stone-ground grits</li>
<li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1 cup low-fat milk</li>
<li>&frac34; cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese (3 ounces)</li>
<li>Freshly ground pepper</li>
</ul><ol><li>
In a medium saucepan, bring 3 &frac12; cups of water to a boil with 1 tablespoon of the butter. Add a generous pinch of salt and gradually whisk in the grits. Cook over moderately low heat, whisking often, until the grits are thick and just tender, about 30 minutes.
</li>
<li>
Meanwhile, in another medium saucepan, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter. Whisk in the flour, and when it is bubbling, gradually whisk in the milk. Cook over moderate heat, whisking frequently, until thickened and no floury taste remains, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in the grated cheese and cook until just melted, about 2 minutes.
</li>
<li>
Using a rubber spatula, fold the Parmesan sauce into the grits and season with salt and pepper. Serve right away.

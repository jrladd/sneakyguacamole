Ok, I totally burnt the candied lemons watching the World Cup, but otherwise, this recipe was easy and tasty.</p>

<p><b>Cake:</b></p>
<ul><li>1 &frac12; cups all-purpose flour</li>
<li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
<li>&frac34; teaspoon kosher salt</li>
<li>1 cup Greek yogurt</li>
<li>&frac34; cup white granulated sugar</li>
<li>&frac14; cup light or dark brown sugar</li>
<li>3 large eggs</li>
<li>2 teaspoons grated lemon zest (From about 2 small lemons)</li>
<li>&frac12; cup olive oil</li>
</ul><p><b>Candied Lemons: </b></p>
<ul><li>1 cup water</li>
<li>1 cup sugar</li>
</ul><p><b>Glaze: </b></p>
<ul><li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
<li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
</ul><ol><li>
<p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease an 8 x 5-inch or 9 x 5-inch loaf pan. (Note I used the latter and it’s just a bit thinner of a pound cake. Both will work just fine.) Line the bottom with parchment paper. Grease and flour the pan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. In another medium-sized bowl, whisk together the yogurt, white sugar, brown sugar, eggs and lemon zest. Slowly whisk the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients. With a rubber spatula, fold the olive oil into the batter, making sure it’s completely incorporated. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for about 40-45 minutes, or until a cake tester placed in the center of the loaf comes out clean.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meanwhile, let’s candy the lemon slices! To a medium saucepan, fill it with water and bring it to a simmer. When the water is rapidly simmering, add the lemon slices and allow to cook for 1 minute. Carefully remove the slices with a pair of tongs and transfer to a cutting board to drain. To the same saucepan, dump out the old water and add 1 cup of water and 1 cup of sugar. Bring mixture to a rapid simmer; add the lemon slices in one layer (none of the lemon slices should be overlapping). Simmer the lemon slices for about 45 minutes to 1 hour. You’ll notice the water/sugar mixture will reduce by a lot and the lemons will become translucent. Remove the lemons from the mixture and transfer to a cooling rack or a parchment-lined baking sheet. <i>[Like I said, pay attention to this; I burnt mine!]</i></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To make the glaze, sift the powdered sugar into a medium bowl. Whisk in two tablespoons of milk and mix until smooth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pour the glaze atop the cake and garnish with candied lemons.</p>

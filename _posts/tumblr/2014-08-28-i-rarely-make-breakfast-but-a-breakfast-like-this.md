I rarely make breakfast, but a breakfast like this makes me want to start the habit! Fresh strawberries, scrambled eggs with ricotta, and local (Windy Lake) sage breakfast sausage! Also: I’ve discovered the secret to good scrambled eggs–half and half! Use 4 eggs (and add another yolk for more creaminess) and 2 tbsp ½ and ½, and season with salt and pepper. Before putting the in pan, melt ½ tbsp of butter. It makes all the difference–no more dried out eggs. Fancy.

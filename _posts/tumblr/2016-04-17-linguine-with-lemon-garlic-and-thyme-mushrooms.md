When I read this recipe, I did a double take. You don’t cook the mushrooms?! But I decided to go with it, and it was delicious! It was maybe almost a little too lemony for my taste, so depending on the size of your lemon, you might not want to use all the juice and zest. Via Food 52. 4 cups (8 ounces) finely sliced cremini or button mushrooms1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil1 tablespoon Maldon or kosher salt or 1 ½ teaspoons table salt1 small clove garlic, minced1 lemon, zested and juiced4 sprigs fresh thyme stripped to give 1 teaspoon leaves1 pound linguine or other pasta shape1 bunch fresh flat-leaf parsley, leaves chopped, to give ½ cup2 to 3 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan, to tasteFreshly ground black pepperSlice the mushrooms finely, and put them into a large bowl with the oil, salt, garlic, lemon juice and zest, and gorgeously scented thyme leaves.Cook the pasta according to the packet instructions and drain loosely retaining some water. Quickly put the pasta into the bowl with the mushroom mixture.Toss everything together well, and then add the parsley, cheese, and pepper before tossing again.

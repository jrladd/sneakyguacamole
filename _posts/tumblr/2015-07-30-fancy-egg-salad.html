<p>When you’re low on fresh produce, and it’s been raining for 2 WEEKS and so you don’t want to go to the store, sometimes you turn to old, easy classics like ramen, tuna fish salad, or pb&amp;j. So when we decided to make egg salad, I thought it’d be fun to jazz it up. I knew I had to go with this egg salad when it had “fancy” in the title. Hopefully, when it clears up, we can have these at a picnic!

Once the water comes to a boil, I let the eggs boil for 10 minutes. Then I pull the eggs off heat, run cold water over the eggs for 30 seconds-1 minute, and then let the eggs sit in cold water until cool enough to peel. I put the egg yolks in a separate bowl to mash up with the mayo, and chop up the egg whites and add to the bowl.]</i></li><li>Toss the eggs in a bowl with the parsley, capers, shallots, and bacon.

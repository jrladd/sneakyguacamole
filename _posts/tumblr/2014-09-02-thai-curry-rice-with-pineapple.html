<p>This was a pretty <a href="http://thaifood.about.com/od/quickeasythairecipes/r/Thai-Curry-Pineapple-Fried-Rice.htm">nice recipe</a> in that it bridged Thai and Chinese tastes (curry and soy)&ndash;though I recognize that fried rice is already an Americanized version of these countries&rsquo; cuisines. While not my favorite dish, I think it would do in a pinch on a weeknight. Plus, I LOVE pineapple.</p><img src="http://65.media.tumblr.com/04d97c3d419aa616ed0f43daef468355/tumblr_inline_nb2qrbV40b1son4ik.jpg" alt="image"/>

<ul><li>1 small can pineapple chunks, drained, OR 1+&frac12; cups fresh pineapple chunks<i> [I used fresh. Cutting up a pineapple&ndash;surprisingly simple.]</i></li>
<li>3-4 cups cooked rice, preferably several days old (Tip: if fresh, leave for an hour or more in the refrigerator uncovered)<i> [I followed the tip and it worked great.]</i></li>
<li>3-4 Tbsp. chicken stock</li>
<li>2 shallots, finely chopped</li>
<li>3 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
<li>1 red or green chili, thinly sliced, OR &frac14; to &frac34; tsp. dried crushed chili (chili flakes)</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
<li>½ cup frozen peas</li>
<li>optional: 1 small carrot, grated (about &frac14; cup)<i> [I like mine in little bites, not grated.]</i></li>
<li>¼ cup raisins or currants</li>
<li>½ cup roasted unsalted whole cashews <i>[I skipped the raisins and cashews because I wanted to be more of a mix of Thai and Chinese, and these ingredients I think would make it less so.]</i></li>
<li>3 spring onions finely sliced</li>
<li>1/3 cup fresh coriander</li>
</ul><p>STIR-FRY SAUCE:</p>
<ul><li>2+&frac12; Tbsp fish sauce, OR 3 Tbps. soy sauce if vegetarian <i>[I had fish sauce but went for the soy, but for a more Thai version, go for that fish sauce!]</i></li>
<li>2 tsp. <a href="http://thaifood.about.com/od/thaicurrypasterecipes/r/Thai-Curry-Powder-Recipe.htm">Thai curry powder</a> OR regular curry powder</li>
</ul><ol><li>If using old rice, pour 1-2 tsp. coconut oil or other vegetable oil onto your fingers and then run fingers through the rice, separating any chunks back into grains. Set aside. <i>[Optional, I didn&rsquo;t do this, but it seems like a good idea &hellip;]</i></li>
<li>In a cup, stir the soy sauce/fish sauce together with the curry powder. Set aside.</li>
<li>Drizzle 1-2 Tbsp. oil in a wok/large frying pan over medium-high heat. Add shallots, garlic, and chili, stir-frying until fragrant (1 minute). Whenever the wok/pan becomes dry, add a little stock (&frac12; to 1 Tbsp. at a time to keep ingredients sizzling).</li>
<li>Push ingredients aside and crack egg into wok, stirring quickly to cook (like making scrambled eggs).</li>
<li>Add the carrot (if using) and peas. Stir-fry 1 minute in the same way, adding more stock if needed.</li>
<li>Now add the rice, pineapple chunks, cashews, and raisins/currents. Drizzle the fish/soy sauce mixed with curry powder over and gently stir-fry to combine over medium-high to high heat until the rice &ldquo;dances&rdquo; (begins to make popping sounds) - about 3 minutes.Tip: Avoid adding any more stock from here on, or your rice will turn out soggy. Add a little more oil if pan becomes too dry (this is how the restaurants achieve that special &lsquo;shine&rsquo; on their fried rice).</li>
<li>Remove from heat. Do a taste-test for saltiness, adding more fish sauce or soy sauce until desired taste is achieved. If you happen to over-salt the dish, add a squeeze or two of lime juice.</li>
<li>To serve, scoop rice onto a serving platter or individual plates and top with spring onions and coriander. ENJOY!</li>

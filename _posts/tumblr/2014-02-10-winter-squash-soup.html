<p>Ina Garten is my homegirl. I love her recipes. They always come out just right (unlike my experience with Martha Stewart recipes &hellip;) and this soup is one of my all time favorites. Sometimes the Contessa gets flak for her recipes having too many (or too expensive) recipes. However, <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ina-garten/winter-squash-soup-recipe.html">this recipe</a> defies those criticisms.</p>

<ul><li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
<li>1 tablespoon good olive oil</li>
<li>2 cups chopped yellow onions (2 onions)</li>
<li>1 (15 - ounce) can pumpkin puree (not pumpkin pie filling)</li>
<li>1 &frac12; pounds butternut squash, peeled and cut in chunks</li>
<li>3 cups homemade chicken stock or canned broth</li>
<li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
<li>&frac12; teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
<li>1 cup half - and - half<br/><br/></li>
</ul><ol><li>Heat the butter and oil in a heavy - bottomed stockpot, add the onions, and cook over medium - low heat for 10 minutes, or until translucent. </li>
<li>Add the pumpkin puree, butternut squash, chicken stock, salt, and pepper. Cover and simmer over medium - low heat for about 20 minutes, until the butternut squash is very tender. </li>
<li>Process the mixture through the medium blade of a food mill. (<i>I use my immersion blender to make the soup smooth.</i>) Return to the pot, add the half - and - half, and heat slowly. If the soup needs more flavor, add another teaspoon of salt. </li>
<li>Serve hot with garnishes <i>(like parmesan and croutons)</i>, if desired.<br/><br/></li>
</ol>

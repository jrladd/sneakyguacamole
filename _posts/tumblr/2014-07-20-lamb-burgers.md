While I appreciated the idea behind Bon Appetit’s recent lamb burgers recipe, to cook the burger in a pita, I just wanted to do it easy style (also without grilling since it was raining), so I took the basic premise and cooked it on my stove in a cast iron. BIG change though: I saw another lamb burger recipe on Serious Eats that recommended putting capers in the burgers. Genius. It was my favorite aspect of the burger. 

[I made a ½ recipe, so while I’ll include the original amounts, I only made 4 burgers with 1 lb of lamb, and cut all ingredients in ½. For the added capers, I added 1 tbsp of capers– that’s the total for a ½ recipe, so if you do Bon Appetit’s version, add at least 2 tbsp capers.]
2½ pounds ground lamb, preferably shoulder
1 medium onion, very finely chopped
¾ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
1 tablespoon ground coriander
¾ teaspoon ground cumin
½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
¼ cup olive oil, plus more for grilling
8 thick medium pita breads with pockets
Using a fork, mix lamb, onion, capers, parsley, coriander, cumin, cinnamon, salt, pepper, and ¼ cup oil in a large bowl. Cover and chill at least 1 hour.
Prepare grill for medium heat and oil grate. Working one at a time, open each pita pocket by cutting along seam, halfway around perimeter. Spoon filling into pitas, spreading to edges. Close, pressing on filling to seal.Grill pitas until filling is cooked through and bread is crisp, about 5 minutes per side. [I just made patties and cooked them on medium heat in a cast iron skillet, about 4-6 minutes per side, depending on how done you’d like them to be! Note: You needn’t oil the pan; the fat of the meat will be enough.]

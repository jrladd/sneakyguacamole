<p>2 &frac12; cups water</p>
<p>1 cup milk</p>
<p>2 tablespoons butter</p>
<p>1/8 teaspoon Tabasco sauce <i>[or in my case, Choula]</i></p>
<p>1/8 teaspoon paprika</p>
<p>1 &frac14; teaspoons salt</p>
<p>Cayenne <i>[the more the better]</i></p>
<p>&frac34; cup quick-cooking grits</p>
<p>&frac14; pound cheddar, grated (about 1 cup) <i>[I rock the shredded]</i></p>
<p>1 red bell pepper, cut into &frac34;-inch squares</p>
<p>1 green bell pepper, cut into &frac34;-inch squares</p>
<p>6 scallions including green tops, sliced thin</p>
<p>2 cups drained and rinsed canned black beans [<i>I just do a can]</i></p>
<p>&frac14; cup canned low-sodium chicken broth or homemade stock <i>[you can eye ball this, I never use a full &frac14; cup]</i></p>
<p>3 plum tomatoes, chopped <i>[I&rsquo;m not a tomato fan, it&rsquo;s my last big food hurdle, but do you]</i></p>
<p><i>Â </i></p>
<ol><li>In a medium saucepan, combine the water, milk, 1 tablespoon of the butter, the Tabasco, paprika, 1 teaspoon of the salt, and 1/8 teaspoon cayenne. Bring to a boil over moderately high heat. Add the grits in a slow stream, whisking. Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon, until the grits are very thick, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the cheese. Cover to keep warm.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, in a large nonstick frying pan, melt the remaining tablespoon of butter over moderate heat. Add the bell peppers and scallions and cook, stirring frequently, until the vegetables start to soften, about 5 minutes. Add the beans, broth, &frac14; teaspoon cayenne, and the remaining &frac14; teaspoon salt. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring frequently, until the beans are hot, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the tomatoes. Serve over the cheese grits.</li>

<p>Sauteing bell peppers&ndash; not very interesting. But I grew this pepper and it looked so seductively scarlet that I couldn&rsquo;t help but post.</p>

This was a pretty nice recipe in that it bridged Thai and Chinese tastes (curry and soy)–though I recognize that fried rice is already an Americanized version of these countries’ cuisines. While not my favorite dish, I think it would do in a pinch on a weeknight. Plus, I LOVE pineapple.

1 small can pineapple chunks, drained, OR 1+½ cups fresh pineapple chunks [I used fresh. Cutting up a pineapple–surprisingly simple.]
3-4 cups cooked rice, preferably several days old (Tip: if fresh, leave for an hour or more in the refrigerator uncovered) [I followed the tip and it worked great.]
3-4 Tbsp. chicken stock
2 shallots, finely chopped
3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1 red or green chili, thinly sliced, OR ¼ to ¾ tsp. dried crushed chili (chili flakes)
1 egg
½ cup frozen peas
optional: 1 small carrot, grated (about ¼ cup) [I like mine in little bites, not grated.]
¼ cup raisins or currants
½ cup roasted unsalted whole cashews [I skipped the raisins and cashews because I wanted to be more of a mix of Thai and Chinese, and these ingredients I think would make it less so.]
3 spring onions finely sliced
1/3 cup fresh coriander
STIR-FRY SAUCE:
2+½ Tbsp fish sauce, OR 3 Tbps. soy sauce if vegetarian [I had fish sauce but went for the soy, but for a more Thai version, go for that fish sauce!]
2 tsp. Thai curry powder OR regular curry powder
If using old rice, pour 1-2 tsp. coconut oil or other vegetable oil onto your fingers and then run fingers through the rice, separating any chunks back into grains. Set aside. [Optional, I didn’t do this, but it seems like a good idea …]
In a cup, stir the soy sauce/fish sauce together with the curry powder. Set aside.
Drizzle 1-2 Tbsp. oil in a wok/large frying pan over medium-high heat. Add shallots, garlic, and chili, stir-frying until fragrant (1 minute). Whenever the wok/pan becomes dry, add a little stock (½ to 1 Tbsp. at a time to keep ingredients sizzling).
Push ingredients aside and crack egg into wok, stirring quickly to cook (like making scrambled eggs).
Add the carrot (if using) and peas. Stir-fry 1 minute in the same way, adding more stock if needed.
Now add the rice, pineapple chunks, cashews, and raisins/currents. Drizzle the fish/soy sauce mixed with curry powder over and gently stir-fry to combine over medium-high to high heat until the rice “dances” (begins to make popping sounds) - about 3 minutes.Tip: Avoid adding any more stock from here on, or your rice will turn out soggy. Add a little more oil if pan becomes too dry (this is how the restaurants achieve that special ‘shine’ on their fried rice).
Remove from heat. Do a taste-test for saltiness, adding more fish sauce or soy sauce until desired taste is achieved. If you happen to over-salt the dish, add a squeeze or two of lime juice.
To serve, scoop rice onto a serving platter or individual plates and top with spring onions and coriander. ENJOY!

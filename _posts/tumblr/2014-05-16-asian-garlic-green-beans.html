<ul><li>1 pound green beans, trimmed</li>
<li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
<li>5 garlic cloves, minced</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
<li>salt and pepper, to taste</li>
<li>1 &amp; 1/2 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
<li>1 teaspoon ginger powder</li>
</ul><p>1. Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil. Add generous amount of salt and add green beans. Cook for about 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Drain and set aside.</p>
<p>2. Heat a large skillet over medium high heat for about 2 minutes. You want it to get pretty hot by itself. Add oil and coat the pan. Add the green beans and saute for about 2-4 minutes, or until they start to brown.</p>
<p>3. Make a well in the center of the skillet and add garlic, ginger powder, and red pepper flakes. Slowly start to incorporate the green beans, until everything is well mixed.</p><img src="http://65.media.tumblr.com/1b5facba7dbf60250093b81e87cc0959/tumblr_inline_n5p60iDV3X1son4ik.jpg" alt="image"/>

<p>Stir in soy sauce and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Serve fresh and hot as a great side or snack!</p>

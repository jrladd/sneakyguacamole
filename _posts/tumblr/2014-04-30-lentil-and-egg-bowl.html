<p>I really don&rsquo;t eat breakfast all that much. I rather sleep until the last minute I can, quickly dress, run out the door with coffee, and have an early lunch. But when I do have breakfast, I want it to be HOT. Therefore, I&rsquo;m always looking for great, warm breakfast ideas. <a href="http://www.vegetariantimes.com/recipe/lentil-and-egg-bowl/">This one</a>, from Vegetarian Times magazine, is one of my FAVS. </p>

<ul><li>1 cup green lentils</li>
<li>½ onion, left whole</li>
<li>2 cloves garlic, smashed</li>
<li>1 bay leaf</li>
<li>1 tsp. butter, optional<i> (I think it&rsquo;s a must  . . )</i></li>
<li>1 squeeze lemon juice</li>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>1 Tbs. chopped chives or green onion <i>(optional)</i></li>
<li>1 Tbs. chopped red bell pepper <i>(optional)</i></li>
</ul><ol><li>Bring lentils and 2 &frac12; cups water to a boil with onion, garlic, and bay leaf. Cover, and simmer 25 minutes, or until liquid is absorbed.</li>
<li>Remove and discard onion, garlic, and bay leaf; stir in 1 tsp. butter (if using); and season with salt and pepper. <i>(I usually just leave the onion and garlic in&ndash;I chop up my onion in this case&ndash; and discard the bay leaf.)</i></li>
<li>Spoon lentils into 2 bowls, add a squeeze of fresh lemon juice, and top each serving with 1 poached egg. Garnish with chives or chopped green onion and chopped red bell pepper.<i><br/></i></li>
</ol>

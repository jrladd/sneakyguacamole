One of the best roast chickens I’ve made. The shallots really make the meal. I served it with oven roasted broccoli. Via NYT. 4 chicken legs or 8 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs [I know it’s sacrilege, but I don’t really like dark meat chicken, so I made a ½ chicken instead. Just be mindful that a big breast takes longer to cook than a thigh or leg] 2 teaspoons kosher salt1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper ½-¾ cup all-purpose flour3 tablespoons olive oil2 tablespoons herbes de Provence1 lemon, quartered 8-10 cloves garlic, peeled 4-6 medium-size shallots, peeled and halved⅓ cup dry vermouth [you can substitute dry white wine]4 sprigs of thyme, for servingPreheat oven to 400. Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Put the flour in a shallow pan, and lightly dredge the chicken in it, shaking the pieces to remove excess flour.Swirl the oil in a large roasting pan, and place the floured chicken in it. Season the chicken with the herbes de Provence. Arrange the lemons, garlic cloves and shallots around the chicken, and then add the vermouth to the pan.Put the pan in the oven, and roast for 25 to 30 minutes, then baste it with the pan juices. Continue roasting for an additional 25 to 30 minutes, or until the chicken is very crisp and the meat cooked through.Serve in the pan or on a warmed platter, garnished with the thyme.

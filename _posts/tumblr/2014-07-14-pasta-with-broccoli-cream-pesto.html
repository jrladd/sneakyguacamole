<p>Yet another success from <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2012/10/spaghetti-with-broccoli-cream-pesto/">Smitten Kitchen</a>. Lately a lot of my pasta sauces have subsisted with food processed vegetables &hellip;</p>

<ul><li>&frac12; pound broccoli</li>
<li>&frac12; pound dried spaghetti <i>(I used orecchiette)</i></li>
<li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
<li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
<li>&frac12; small onion, finely chopped</li>
<li>1 clove garlic, minced (or, more to taste)</li>
<li>&frac12; teaspoon table salt</li>
<li>Freshly ground black pepper or pinches of red pepper flakes</li>
<li>4 tablespoons heavy cream</li>
<li>A heap of grated parmesan (about &frac12; cup), to serve</li>
</ul><ol><li>
<p>Bring a large pot of salted water to boil for your pasta.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove broccoli florets from stems and chop into medium florets. Peel stems with a vegetable peeler (I do this so that they cook quickly, plus, I prefer their taste without the tough stem skin.) and slice them into &frac12;-inch segments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use your pot of future pasta water to steam (by suspending a mesh strainer over your pasta pot and covering it with a lid for 5 to 6 minutes)) or par-boil (for 3 to 5 minutes) your broccoli florets and stems until just tender, then drain if needed and set them aside.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add pasta to water and cook until al dente, or about one minute less than fully cooked. Before draining pasta, reserve a cup of pasta cooking water and set it aside. Drain pasta.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wipe out pot so that you can use it again. In the bottom of pot, melt butter and olive oil together over medium heat. Add onion and reduce to medium-low, sauteing it until tender, about 7 minutes. Add garlic and cook for another two minutes. Add steamed broccoli, salt and red or black pepper and turn the heat back up to medium-high, cooking it with the onion and garlic for a few additional minutes. Pour cream over mixture and let cook for 30 seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transfer broccoli mixture and all of its creamy bits at the bottom of the pan to a blender or food processor and blend in short bursts until it’s finely chopped and a little sauce. Don’t worry if it looks dry; that reserved pasta water will give it the sauciness it needs in a minute. (Theoretically, one could also use an immersion blender here inside their pot to make the broccoli sauce, but it might be a bit messy with all of the chunks and small bits.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the broccoli sauce back to the pot with the drained spaghetti and a splash or two of the reserved pasta water. Cook over medium-high for 1 to 2 minutes, tossing the mixture so that it evenly coats. Add more pasta water as needed to loosen the sauce. Adjust seasonings to taste, adding more salt or pepper, and scoop into a serving bowl. Shower spaghetti with grated parmesan and dig in.</p>
</li>

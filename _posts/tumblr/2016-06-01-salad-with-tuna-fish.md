If you read this blog, then I’m sure you’re familiar with my dis-ease with salads. I just don’t get what all the fuss is about! But I’m trying, and I will say that this was both tasty and filling! I borrowed ideas from Joy the Baker and Shockingly Delicious.1 (5-ounce) can albacore tuna2-3 tablespoons red onion, sliced paper thinseveral large leaves kale, stem removed and leaves cut in a chiffonade (depending on how much greens you want)a couple green onions, thinly sliced 2 stalks thinly sliced celery1 ½ tablespoons capers, draineda handful of sliced almondsolive oil, lemon juice, rice vinegarFreshly ground pepperKosher salt (taste salad before adding)grated parmesan cheeseInstructionsToss kale in a large bowl with a splash of olive oil, rice vinegar, and/or lemon (your dressing preference!). Season with a bit of salt and pepper and set aside.In a separate medium bowl, combine tuna, green onion, red onion, and capers. Season with salt and pepper to taste.Add the tuna mixture and sliced almonds to the kale bowl. Toss to combine. Garnish with parmesan as desired.

<p>After returning from Italy, where my fella and I spent two weeks, you think we’d be tired of pasta &hellip; NOPE. And since olive oil constitutes an important component of the sauce, I opened my new fancy Italian olive oil! I’m the worst about using new things, because I want them to last forever, but why buy olive oil and not eat it?

<p>John refuses to admit this is chili. He concedes that it&rsquo;s super tasty but that it certainly isn&rsquo;t chili. I&rsquo;m a Southerner. I believe in white chili. PLUS we get ground turkey semi often in our CSA. I don&rsquo;t know about you, but for me, ground turkey is BORING. This is a fantastical way to use it.</p>

<ul><li><b>1 tablespoon olive oil</b></li>
<li><b>1 medium onion, diced (about 1 &frac12; cups)</b></li>
<li><b>2 stalks celery, diced (about &frac12; cup)</b></li>
<li><b>3 medium poblano peppers (about 4 ounces each), seeded and white ribs removed, finely diced (about 1 &frac12; cups) <i>(I had frozen green chilies)</i></b></li>
<li><b>1 clove garlic, minced</b></li>
<li><b>1 teaspoon ground cumin</b></li>
<li><b>&frac12; teaspoon ground coriander</b></li>
<li><b>&frac14; teaspoon cayenne pepper, more to taste</b></li>
<li><b>1 pound ground white meat turkey</b></li>
<li><b>2 (15.5-ounce) cans white beans such as cannelini, preferably low-sodium, drained and rinsed <i>(We used dried beans that we had pre-quick soaked, because that&rsquo;s all we had!)</i></b></li>
<li><b>4 cups low-sodium chicken broth</b></li>
<li><b>&frac34; teaspoon dried oregano</b></li>
<li><b>1 (15.5-ounce) can hominy, drained and rinsed <i>(I love hominy but I didn&rsquo;t have any, so I used barley, which was an amazing substitute)</i></b></li>
<li><b>Salt</b></li>
<li><b>&frac14; cup nonfat plain Greek-style yogurt <i>(optional, I didn&rsquo;t add any)</i></b></li>
<li><b>2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro leavesÂ <b><i>(optional, I didn&rsquo;t add any</i></b></b><b><b><i>)</i></b></b></li>
<li><b>Lime wedges <i>(lime juice actually made a HUGE difference to this dish, so if you have lime, squeeze those bitches over this chili)</i></b></li>
</ul><ol><li><b>Heat the oil in large pot or Dutch oven over moderate heat. Add the onion, celery, poblanos, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are soft, about 8 minutes. Add the garlic, cumin, coriander and cayenne and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</b></li>
<li><b>Add the ground turkey and cook, breaking up the meat with a spoon, until the meat is no longer pink about 2 minutes <i>(it took me longer, more like 5-10 mins</i>). Add the white beans, broth and oregano. Cook, partially covered, stirring occasionally, for 25 minutes.</b></li>
<li><b>Add the hominy and salt and more cayenne pepper, to taste, and continue cooking, partially covered, 10 minutes longer. Ladle into individual bowls and top each serving with 1 tablespoon of yogurt and 1 &frac12; teaspoons of cilantro. Garnish with a lime wedge. <i>(John and I like a creamier chili, so we just immersion blendered the chili up a little. But whatever you like consistency-wise!)</i><br/><br/></b></li>
</ol><p><b>YUM!</b></p>

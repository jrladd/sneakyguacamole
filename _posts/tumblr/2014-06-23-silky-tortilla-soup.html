<p>So on our bi-annual family vacation, in which my ENTIRE mother&rsquo;s side (about 30-35 of us) go to the beach together and stay in one house, every family is in charge of one night of cooking. For the first time ever, the grandkids cooked one night! We hosted a taco night, and I contributed <a href="http://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/silky-tortilla-soup/">this tortilla soup from Food &amp; Wine!</a></p>

<ul><li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
<li>1 large white onion, thinly sliced</li>
<li>5 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
<li>Kosher salt</li>
<li>1 &frac12; pounds plum tomatoes, halved</li>
<li>4 chipotle chiles in adobo sauce, seeded and coarsely chopped <i>**Note&ndash; I didn&rsquo;t think this would be enough, so I added another couple. Bad idea. It was SUPER spicy. Lesson learned&ndash;just follow the recipe, haha.</i></li>
<li>8 cups chicken stock</li>
<li>Canola oil, for frying</li>
<li>6 corn tortillas, halved and thinly sliced</li>
<li>1 stick unsalted butter, diced</li>
<li>4 cups shredded chicken, from one 2 &frac14;-pound rotisserie chicken</li>
<li>Crumbled queso fresco, dried chile and cilantro leaves, for garnish</li>
</ul><ol><li>In a saucepan, heat the olive oil until shimmering. Add the onion, garlic and a generous pinch of salt and cook over moderate heat, stirring, until softened and starting to brown, 8 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, chipotle chiles and stock and bring to a boil. Simmer over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes are very soft, 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, in a skillet, heat &frac14; inch of canola oil. Add half of the tortilla strips and fry over moderate heat, stirring, until crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the strips to paper towels. Season with salt. Repeat with the remaining strips.</li>
<li>Carefully ladle half of the soup into a blender and add half of the butter. Puree until smooth. Pour the pureed soup into a large saucepan. Repeat with the remaining soup and butter. Stir in the shredded chicken and gently reheat the soup. Season with salt.</li>
<li>Serve the soup in bowls, garnishing with <i>queso fresco,</i> chile, cilantro and tortilla strips.</li>
</ol><p>Enjoy!</p>

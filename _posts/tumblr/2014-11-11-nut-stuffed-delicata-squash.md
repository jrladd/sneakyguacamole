This comes from our old CSA at Maude’s Market (we miss you!). 
3 tablespoons butter
2 medium yellow onions, finely chopped
3 garlic cloves, minced
¾ teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage
1 ⅔ cup pecan pieces   
⅓ cup plain Greek yogurt
2 eggs, lightly beaten
About ½ cup freshly shredded parmesan cheese
2 delicata squash, halved lengthwise and seeded
Preheat oven to 350°.
Melt butter in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Add onions, garlic, and salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are soft, about 3 minutes. Stir in sage and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in nuts. Set aside.
In a large bowl, combine yogurt, eggs, and ½ cup Parmesan. Stir in nut mixture. Divide stuffing among squash halves, sprinkle with more Parmesan, and bake until tender when pierced with a fork and tops are brown, about 45 minutes.

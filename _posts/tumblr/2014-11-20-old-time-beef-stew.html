<p>Always willing to try a new beef stew recipe. I prefer Pepin&rsquo;s Red Wine Beef Stew (which I&rsquo;ve posted on this blog), but John prefers a more gravy based traditional beef stew. I think I preferred the other one (on the blog as Old Fashioned Beef Stew) more, but <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/paula-deen/old-time-beef-stew-recipe.html">this recipe</a> was still solid (and very easy).Â </p>

<ul><li>2 pounds stew beef</li>
<li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
<li>2 cups water</li>
<li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
<li>1 clove garlic, peeled</li>
<li>1 or 2 bay leaves</li>
<li>1 medium onion, sliced</li>
<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
<li>&frac12; teaspoon pepper</li>
<li>&frac12; teaspoon paprika</li>
<li>Dash ground allspice or ground cloves</li>
<li>3 large carrots, sliced<br/></li>
<li>3 ribs celery, chopped</li>
<li><i>turnips (my addition, makes it more hardy, 1 large one or a couple medium ones diced, about an equal amount to the carrots and celery)</i></li>
<li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
</ul><ol><li>Brown meat in hot oil. <i>(Remember it will stew for hours, so you only need to brown it, not ensure it&rsquo;s fully cooked through.)<img src="http://67.media.tumblr.com/1ffe43ff94ee318e37bfdfa1a64fc7f0/tumblr_inline_nf7wbxBUH31son4ik.jpg" alt="image"/></i>

</li>
<li>Add water, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, bay leaves, onion, salt, sugar, pepper, paprika, and allspice. Cover and simmer 1 &frac12; hours. </li>
<li>Remove bay leaves and garlic clove. Add carrots and celery. Cover and cook 30 to 40 minutes longer. </li>
<li>To thicken gravy, remove 2 cups hot liquid. Using a separate bowl, combine &frac14; cup water and cornstarch until smooth. Mix with a little hot liquid and return mixture to pot. Stir and cook until bubbly.</li>
</ol>

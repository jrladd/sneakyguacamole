These were really tasty, and I&rsquo;m sad that I waited so long to blog this, because now the link to the recipe is broken on her site! For now, ogle. I&rsquo;ll try to get the recipe up eventually!</p>

<p><em>Edit: She re-posted it! Here&rsquo;s <a href="http://joythebaker.com/2014/05/campfire-scones/">the recipe</a>. I thought it was great. I couldn&rsquo;t get her marshmallow icing to work. So for my second attempt I used Alton Brown&rsquo;s meringue recipe, and that worked out well for me.</em></p>

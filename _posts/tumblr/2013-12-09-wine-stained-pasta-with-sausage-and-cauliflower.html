<p>This dinner is the jam. Pasta will never be the same.</p>
<p>Brought to you by <a href="https://abc.go.com/shows/the-chew/recipes/Holidays-Mario-Batali-Gemelli-Sausage-Meatballs-Cauliflower?printable=1">Mario Batali/The Chew</a> and WINE.</p><img src="http://67.media.tumblr.com/97587ad3f9da288dff4e23dee04518cf/tumblr_inline_mxkt4nEMNx1son4ik.jpg" alt="image"/>
<ul><li>2 pound sweet Italian sausage (casings removed)<i> (I use about a &frac12; lb to 1 lb.)</i></li>
<li>&frac14; cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
<li>1 medium head cauliflower (cut into small florets)</li>
<li>1 cup plus 4 liters inexpensive red wine</li>
<li>2 cups basic tomato sauce <i>(see note below)</i></li>
<li>2 tablespoon salt</li>
<li>1 &frac12; pound garganelli pasta <i>(or 1 lb)</i></li>
<li>1 cup freshly grated Pecorino Romano <i>(I like Parm)</i></li>
</ul><ol><li>Using your hands, form the sausage into balls about the size of almonds. In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat the oil over medium heat until just smoking. Add the sausage balls in two batches, and saute, rolling them around, until they are browned all over, 5 to 6 minutes per batch. Remove, and set aside on a plate. <i>(Personally, I just brown the sausage, then set it aside and add it to the pasta later. You don&rsquo;t really need little meatballs unless you want them because they&rsquo;re cute.)</i></li>
<li>Add the cauliflower to the pan and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Drain off the fat, and add the 1 cup red wine to the cauliflower. Bring to a boil, and then add the tomato sauce and sausage balls. <i>(For the tomato sauce, just add any sauce you have or make your own basic. I take a can of whole tomatoes in their sauce and add to a pot. I break up the tomatoes with a fork and add salt, pepper, basil, oregano, and one spoonful of sugar. Let boil for a few minutes, then if you like smoother sauce, which I do, I immersion blender the sauce. Add two cups, and just refrigerate or freeze any extra sauce for another day.)</i></li>
<li>Bring to a boil again. Then lower the heat to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.</li>
<li>Pour the 4 liters of red wine into a large pasta pot. Add the salt and 4 cups of water, and bring to a boil. <i>(Aka, &frac34;-1 whole bottle of some cheap, red 2 buck Chuck&ndash;thanks Trader Joes!)</i></li>
<li>Drop the garganelli <i>(or another good shaped pasta, we used gemilli)</i> into the boiling wine/water, and cook for 1 minute less than the package instructions indicate. Just before the pasta is done, carefully ladle &frac12; cup of the cooking wine/water into the sausage mixture.</li>
<li>Drain the pasta in a colander and add it to the sausage mixture. Toss until pasta is nicely coated. Pour in a warming serving bowl and serve immediately, with CHEESE.</li>
</ol><p><b>YUM!</b></p>

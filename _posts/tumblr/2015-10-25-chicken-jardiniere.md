This was DELICIOUS! Definitely need to remake…Via Tasting Table and the always fabulous Jacques Pepin.5 ounces thick-cut bacon, cut into ¼-inch batons (about 4-5 slices depending on the thickness of your bacon)1 tablespoon canola oil4 chicken legs (about 2¼ pounds)—skins removed, drumstick and thighs separated, patted dry [I used a ½ chicken, since I like white meat and my partner likes dark, and all the pieces still cooked through, so feel free to use the pieces you like most, as he describes– bone on, skin removed. While I usually like to keep the skin on for more flavor, you’re braising the chicken here, so skin off is better.]Kosher salt, to taste3 tablespoons all-purpose flour¾ cup dry white wine1½ cups water½ pound baby red potatoes8 pearl onions, peeled [Or thick cut pieces of onion, if you don’t have pearl.]3 large carrots, cut into 2-inch pieces2 garlic cloves, smashed and finely minced5 thyme sprigsFreshly ground black pepper, to taste¼ pound cremini mushrooms, halved or quartered if large1 cup frozen baby peas, thawed2 tablespoons roughly chopped flat-leaf parsley, for garnishCrusty bread, for servingIn a large heavy-bottomed saucepan or Dutch oven, heat the bacon and oil over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the fat renders and the bacon is crisp, 8 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate. Set aside.Add the chicken legs to the pot, increase the heat to medium high and season with salt. Cook the chicken, turning occasionally, until brown on all sides, 10 to 12 minutes. Sprinkle with the flour and stir to distribute evenly, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the wine and reduce by half, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the water, potatoes, pearl onions, carrots, garlic, thyme and reserved bacon. Season with more salt and pepper, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium, cover and cook until the chicken is cooked through and the vegetables are tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Add the mushrooms, cover and cook for 5 more minutes. Stir in the peas and cook for another 2 minutes to heat through. Taste and adjust the seasoning.To serve, garnish the stew with parsley and serve with crusty bread on the side.

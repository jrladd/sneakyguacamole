<p>Turnips! I had no clue what a turnip was until last year, when I first got them in my CSA box. Turnips are yummy little root vegetables that are like potatoes but with a tangy-er taste. You can mash them, puree them, roast them. But my personal favorite&ndash; risotto them. Now risotto is known to be extremely difficult to make. The way I do it isn&rsquo;t hard at all, but I also don&rsquo;t claim to be doing it right. All I know is it&rsquo;s totes nommy at the end.</p>

<p>Brought to you by <a href="http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Risotto-with-Turnips-and-Bacon-15760">Epicurious</a> and my <a href="http://www.maudesmarket.com/weekly-buyers-club-csa">Maude&rsquo;s Market</a> CSA box.</p>

<ul><li>3 bacon slices</li>
<li>1 small onion</li>
<li>2 medium turnips (preferably with greens; about &frac12; pound total)</li>
<li>3 &frac12; cups chicken broth</li>
<li>&frac34; cup Arborio rice</li>
</ul><ul><li>Garnish: freshly grated Parmesan</li>
</ul><p>In a 3-quart heavy saucepan cook bacon over moderate heat until crisp and golden and transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. <i>Making more than 3 slices is not a bad idea; when is more bacon bad? I personally did 4 big slices.</i> Reserve 1 tablespoon fat in pan. Chop onion. Peel turnips and cut into &frac14;-inch dice (if using greens, cut into &frac14;-inch-wide slices and chop stems). In a separate saucepan bring broth to a simmer and keep at a bare simmer.</p>
<p>Heat reserved fat over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sauté onion, stirring, until just beginning to soften. Stir in turnips (and greens if using, <i>in this case my greens were wilted so I added fresh corn kernels instead for brightness in taste and appearance</i>) and rice and sauté, stirring constantly, 1 minute.<i> I don&rsquo;t think risotto is risotto without wine, so here I added about a &frac14; cup of dry white wine, and waited until absorbed before adding broth</i>. Stir in 1 cup simmering broth and cook, stirring constantly and keeping at a strong simmer, until absorbed. Continue simmering and adding broth, about &frac12; cup at a time, stirring constantly and letting each addition be absorbed before adding next, until rice is tender and creamy-looking but still al dente, about 18 minutes total. <i>For me, this was a little too bland, so I added some salt, pepper, and about a tablespoon of butter to richen it.</i></p>
<p>Crumble bacon. Serve risotto sprinkled with bacon and garnished with Parmesan.</p>

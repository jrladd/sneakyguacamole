John thought people might wonder what he eats when I’m not home or when he cooks. So here we have steel coat oats oatmeal and apples cooked in butter and brown sugar. He says it’s based on LV Anderson’s “You’re Doing It Wrong” Slate column. She insists rolled oats are better because they’re creamy, but what she calls creamy, John calls mushy. So he makes almost the same recipe but with steel cut oats. Note: I wouldn’t know; I hate oatmeal.

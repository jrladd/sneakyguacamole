Hey guys! Sadly, I couldn’t go to Thanksgiving with my family this year. Super let down, because, for those who don’t know, we have about 25-30+ people stuffed into my house and more food than most buffet lines. Also, my family is craze. There’s often stories of my aunt giving my grandmother an enema, my cousins shooting bow and arrows in the backyard, and drawings for our pet secret santa. It’s the bomb dot com. BUT I did have the first annual pajama fest with John and Cardigan today, which was AMAZE. And since I love to cook, I figured if I couldn’t go home, I’d go all out this year. Therefore, several posts will follow this one showing my multiple day cooking fest; our menu included:
Cheese Gougeres
Chicken and Sausage Gumbo
Soy and Ginger Lacquered Cornish Hens
Homemade Green Bean Casserole
Cheddar Jalapeno Mashed Potatoes
Pumpkin Pie, with homemade whipped cream
Salted Caramel Chocolate Pecan Pie
YAY!

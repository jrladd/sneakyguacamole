<p>For Christmas gifts this year, I went on a cooking palooza and made three different types of cookies and these caramels. So this is HOLIDAY GIFT PALOOZA-PART 1: boozy caramels.</p>

<ul><li>nonstick vegetable oil spray</li>
<li>2 cups sugar</li>
<li>&frac12; cup light corn syrup</li>
<li>1  14 oz. can sweetened condensed milk</li>
<li>&frac12; cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces</li>
<li>2 tablespoons bourbon</li>
<li>&frac12; teaspoon kosher salt</li>
<li>flaky sea salt (such as Maldon)</li>
</ul><p>Lightly coat a 8 x 8″ baking pan with nonstick spray and line with parchment paper, leaving a 2″ overhang on 2 sides; spray parchment.</p>
<p>Bring sugar, corn syrup, &frac14; cup water to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring to dissolve sugar. Cook, swirling pan occasionally, until mixture turns a deep amber color, 8 -10 minutes.  (It took me about 12-14 minutes.) </p>
<p>Remove pan from heat and whisk in sweetened condensed milk and butter (mixture will bubble vigorously) until smooth. Fit pan with candy thermometer and return to medium-low heat. Cook, whisking constantly, until thermometer registers 240F. <i>&ndash;Do use your candy thermometer, my last attempt at caramel never set because my thermometer was off. Check that your thermometer is correct first, by placing it in boiling water and making sure it meets the temp of boiling water. Make sure your caramels get to firm ball stage (245-250 degrees).</i></p>
<p>Remove from heat and whisk in the bourbon and kosher salt. Pour into prepared pan; let cool. Sprinkle caramel with sea salt, cut into 1 inch pieces and wrap individually in parchment paper.</p>
<p>Caramels can be made up to 2 weeks ahead. Store wrapped tightly in plastic in an airtight container at room temperature. I have mine in the fridge.</p>
<p>Tasty!</p>

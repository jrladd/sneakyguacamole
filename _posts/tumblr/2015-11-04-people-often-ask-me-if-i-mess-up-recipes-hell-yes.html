Luckily, the more you cook, the more you come to understand how cooking works through trial and error, and the less you theoretically mess up. However, it still happens! These were supposed to be chai spiced shortbread cookies. Shortbread cookies are not supposed to spread in the oven! So what I ended up with were sandy cookies that fell apart. What happened? Who knows? Maybe my dough wasn’t cold enough (warm dough tends to spread)? Maybe the proportions of the recipe I tried to make were off? Anyway, this was just a moment to admit what food blogs often don’t&ndash; which is that sometimes, food just doesn’t turn out right.</p>

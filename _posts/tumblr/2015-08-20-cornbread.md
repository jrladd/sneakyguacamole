What better to do when fresh corn is plentiful? Via Cook’s Illustrated.1 1/3 cups (6 2/3 ounces) stone-ground cornmeal [I buy mine bulk from Whole Foods, so I can control the amount, since I don’t use it for much else than this purpose.]1 cup (5 ounces) all-purpose flour2 tablespoons sugar1 ½ teaspoons baking powder¼ teaspoon baking soda1 ¼ teaspoons salt3 ears corn, kernels cut from cobs (2 ¼ cups)6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 6 pieces1 cup buttermilk [I usually make my own buttermilk.]2 large eggs plus 1 large yolkAdjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Whisk cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in large bowl.Process corn kernels in blender until very smooth, about 2 minutes. [I assumed they didn’t want me to blanch or cook the corn before hand, so it’s raw corn kernels off the cob.] Transfer puree to medium saucepan (you should have about 1½ cups). Cook puree over medium heat, stirring constantly, until very thick and deep yellow and it measures ¾ cup, 5 to 8 minutes.Remove pan from heat. Add 5 tablespoons butter and whisk until melted and incorporated. Add buttermilk and whisk until incorporated. Add eggs and yolk and whisk until incorporated. Transfer corn mixture to bowl with cornmeal mixture and, using rubber spatula, fold together until just combined.Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in 10-inch cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Scrape batter into skillet and spread into even layer. Bake until top is golden brown and toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, 23 to 28 minutes. Let cool on wire rack for 5 minutes. Remove cornbread from skillet and let cool for 20 minutes before cutting into wedges and serving.

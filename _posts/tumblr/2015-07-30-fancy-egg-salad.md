When you’re low on fresh produce, and it’s been raining for 2 WEEKS and so you don’t want to go to the store, sometimes you turn to old, easy classics like ramen, tuna fish salad, or pb&j. So when we decided to make egg salad, I thought it’d be fun to jazz it up. I knew I had to go with this egg salad when it had “fancy” in the title. Hopefully, when it clears up, we can have these at a picnic! Via NYT. 4 hard-cooked eggs, peeled1 tablespoon Italian parsley, finely chopped1 tablespoon capers, dried, finely chopped1 large shallot, peeled, finely chopped1 slice of bacon, crisp, finely chopped1 ½ tablespoons mayonnaise Salt and pepperPut the eggs into a gently boiling pot of water and cook for 30 minutes. Cool with water, peel, and chop. [Just do whatever boiled egg method is your favorite. I put the eggs in the pot, fill with water, and then turn on medium-high. Once the water comes to a boil, I let the eggs boil for 10 minutes. Then I pull the eggs off heat, run cold water over the eggs for 30 seconds-1 minute, and then let the eggs sit in cold water until cool enough to peel. I put the egg yolks in a separate bowl to mash up with the mayo, and chop up the egg whites and add to the bowl.]Toss the eggs in a bowl with the parsley, capers, shallots, and bacon. Season with salt and pepper to taste, then add the mayo and mix well. Serve with fresh bread, crackers, on hearts of romaine, or in a salad.

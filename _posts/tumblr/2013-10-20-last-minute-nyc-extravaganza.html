<p>So, you may have been thinking: Well, that&rsquo;s it. Keeping up a blog is hard, so we can&rsquo;t blame her, but this is it. </p>
<p>NOPE. I&rsquo;M BACK!</p>
<p>While lately I have been busy with juggling my job, applying to grad schools, a boyfriend, a kitty, and you know, adult life, the main reason I&rsquo;ve been MIA is a completely unexpected and wholly lovely trip to NYC. </p>
<p>My parents have been planning a trip all year to NYC with friends. The Monday before flying out Friday, my father became too ill to attend. Luckily, he&rsquo;s fine now, but he knew he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to handle the walking required of a NYC trip. Therefore, he called me and gave me a cute spiel about how my mother was threatening to cancel the trip to stay with him, and how this would be a waste, and how much he wanted her to go and have a great time. How could I say no to that? Especially since I am a huge musical theater/art museum/big city nut. Therefore, after working out my shifts with my generous co-workers, and ensuring my cat and fella would survive on their own for a weekend, I flew off to NYC!</p>

<p>There I saw AMAZING shows like <em>Matilda</em> (unlike ANYTHING I&rsquo;VE EVER SEEN), <em>Once</em> (intimate and I got to meet Arthur Darvill), and <em>Kinky Boots</em> (blown away by the leads). I enjoyed the weather by taking the Staten Island Ferry, walking the Brooklyn Bridge, and visiting the High Line. I shopped at Chelsea Market and rode the subway and mostly importantly&hellip;ATE. ATE ATE ATE.</p>

<p>Look at these beautiful spices at Chelsea Market!</p>

<p>Pumpkin milkshake= officially fall.</p>
<p>I was so stuffed all weekend. I thought I&rsquo;d share a couple of the things I ate, since, duh, this is a food blog. :)</p>
<p>The first crazy meal I ate was at Marcus Samuelsson&rsquo;s <a href="http://redroosterharlem.com/">Red Rooster</a> in Harlem. If you don&rsquo;t know him, he&rsquo;s a badass. Ethiopian born, Swedish raised, Top Chef Master winner, Food Network personality. Handsome to boot too. </p>

<p>We had brunch there. Let me just say. Tomato jam and cornbread. Crawfish and brie grits. Fried oysters in hollandaise on top of fluffy baked eggs with bacon and tomatoes. </p>

<p>We had pizza in Brooklyn at<a href="http://www.julianaspizza.com/"> Julianna&rsquo;s Pizza</a>. Super interesting history, delicious pizza, possibly the BEST ice cream I&rsquo;ve ever had in my life, made just for that restaurant by Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory: raspberry chocolate chunk. UGH.</p>
<p>Surprisingly delicious meal of the trip: the prix fix menu at the MOMA&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.momacafes.com/t5/t5.html">Terrace 5</a>. Though, I shouldn&rsquo;t have been surprised because it&rsquo;s run by Danny Meyer&rsquo;s group. Red curry squash soup, brushetta, fresh figs with creme fresh. </p>
<p>(I tried to not be obnoxious and take pictures of everything, so use your <em>Ratatouille</em> imagination. You know the scene I&rsquo;m talking about: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yyah49_Oz78.</p>
<p>Last great meal I&rsquo;ll discuss: thai at Harold Dieterle&rsquo;s (the first Top Chef winner) restaurant <a href="http://www.kinshopnyc.com/">Kin Shop</a> in Hell&rsquo;s Kitchen. All I have to say is&ndash; they have thai ice tea ICE CREAM. I was sold. Probably my favorite part was our appetizer&ndash;spicy duck laab. Mmmm. My entree was like nothing I&rsquo;ve ever tasted before: red onion congee with a steamed egg and squid. Congee is like a sort of soupy grits? And I die for grits. I also finished everyone else&rsquo;s meals because the food was so delish so I also had northern thai curry, dungeness crab noodles, and pad see ew. </p>

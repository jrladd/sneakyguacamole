<p>I’m SO READY for it to be spring, and it’s slowing starting to warm up here. I really want to get into my garden and start planting fresh herbs and veggies I can integrate into my cooking! But until then, I’ll make due with recipes like this from Cooks Illustrated!</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="3264" data-orig-width="2448"><img src="http://67.media.tumblr.com/a3765a11f40ed29b941a8658defd2b6a/tumblr_inline_o4x08fgzar1son4ik_540.jpg" data-orig-height="3264" data-orig-width="2448"/></figure><p>GREMOLATA</p><p>(if you have the ingredients for this, rock on and do it, but if you don’t, it’s still delicious and worth making without)</p><ul><li>2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley leaves, stems reserved</li><li>2tablespoons minced fresh mint leaves, stems reserved</li><li>½ teaspoon finely grated zest from 1 lemon</li></ul><p>RISOTTO</p><ul><li>1 pound asparagus, tough ends snapped off and reserved, spears cut on bias into ½-inch thick pieces</li><li>2 medium leeks, white and light green parts halved lengthwise, washed, and sliced thin (about 4 cups)</li><li>2 cups roughly chopped greens reserved (see note)</li><li>4 cups low-sodium chicken broth (see note**)</li><li>3 cups water </li><li>5 tablespoons unsalted butter</li><li>Salt and ground black pepper<br/></li><li>½ cup <a href="http://www.cooksillustrated.com/taste_tests/233-frozen-peas">frozen peas</a></li><li>2 medium garlic cloves, minced or pressed through garlic press (about 2 teaspoons)</li><li>1 ½ cups Arborio rice (see note)</li><li>1 cup dry white wine</li><li>1 ½ ounces grated Parmesan cheese (about ¾ cup), plus extra for serving</li><li>2 teaspoons juice from 1 lemon</li></ul><p><br/>SERVES 4 AS A MAIN COURSE OR 6 AS A FIRST COURSE</p><p>To make this dish vegetarian, replace the chicken broth with vegetable broth. Onions can be substituted for the leeks. If substituting onions, use 1 roughly chopped medium onion (1 cup) in the broth and 2 minced medium onions (2 cups) in the risotto. *<b>At the end of cooking, you may have up to a cup of broth left over.* </b></p><ol><li><b>For the Gremolata: </b>Combine ingredients in small bowl and set aside.<br/></li><li><b>For the Risotto: </b>Chop tough asparagus ends and leek greens into rough &frac12;-inch pieces. Bring chopped vegetables, reserved parsley and mint stems, broth, and water to boil in large saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, partially cover, and simmer 20 minutes. Strain broth through fine-mesh strainer into medium bowl, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Return strained broth to saucepan; cover and set over low heat to keep broth warm.<br/></li><li>Heat 1 tablespoon butter in large Dutch oven over medium heat. When foaming subsides, add asparagus spears, pinch of salt, and pepper to taste. Cook, stirring occasionally, until asparagus is crisp-tender, 4 to 6 minutes. Add peas and continue to cook 1 minute. Transfer vegetables to plate and set aside.<br/></li><li>Melt 3 tablespoons butter in now-empty Dutch oven over medium heat. When foaming subsides, add leeks, garlic, &frac12; teaspoon salt, and &frac12; teaspoon pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until leeks are softened, 4 to 5 minutes. Add rice and cook, stirring frequently, until grains are translucent around edges, about 3 minutes. Add wine and cook, stirring frequently, until fully absorbed, 2 to 3 minutes.<br/></li><li>When wine is fully absorbed, add 3 cups hot broth to rice. Simmer, stirring every 3 to 4 minutes, until liquid is absorbed and bottom of pan is almost dry, about 12 minutes.<br/></li><li>Stir in about &frac12; cup hot broth and cook, stirring constantly, until absorbed, about 3 minutes; repeat with additional broth 3 or 4 times until rice is al dente. <i><b> [Remember, you may have broth left over. Don’t judge your risotto by broth remaining; instead, taste your risotto rice for the consistency you want!] </b></i></li><li>Off heat, stir in remaining tablespoon butter, Parmesan, and lemon juice; gently fold in asparagus and peas. If desired, add up to &frac14; cup additional hot broth to loosen texture of risotto. Serve immediately, sprinkling each serving with gremolata and passing Parmesan separately.<br/></li></ol>

I love a good chicken broth based soup. Via Shutterbean.8 oz. ground chicken½ cup panko breadcrumbs4 tablespoons finely grated Parmesan, plus more for serving5 garlic cloves, 3 minced, 2 thinly sliced1 tablespoon fresh pesto1 large eggkosher salt & fresh cracked pepper2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil1 leek, white and pale green parts only, sliced into 1/4″ rounds5 cups chicken broth¾ cup alphabet pasta (or other small pasta)1 cup 1/2″ rounds peeled carrots2 cups (packed) baby spinach [I used sorrel, and any green would be good!]pinch red pepper flakeschopped fresh basil, for servingMix chicken, breadcrumbs, Parmesan 3 minced garlic cloves, pesto, egg, 2/4 teaspoon salt & ¼ teaspoon pepper in a medium bowl. Form into 1/2″ diameter meatballs (makes about 28).Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook meatballs until golden all over, about 3 minutes (they will finish cooking in the soup). Transfer to a plate and set aside.Add leek to pot and cook, stirring often, until beginning to soften, about 3 minutes. Add 2 thinly sliced garlic cloves; cook for 1 minute. Add broth and 2 cups water; bring to a boil. Stir in pasta and carrots; simmer until pasta is almost al dente, about 8 minutes. Add meatballs; simmer until pasta is al dente, carrots are tender and meatballs are cooked through, about 3 minutes. Add spinach cool until spinach has wilted. Season with red pepper flakes, salt & pepper. Ladle soup into bowls. Garnish with chopped basil and Parmesan.

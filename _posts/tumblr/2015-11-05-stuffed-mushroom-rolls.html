<p>This is a great appetizer, especially to bring to a party! You can use store bought pizza dough, or make your own, and it’s relatively easy to do! Via <a href="http://www.shutterbean.com/2014/stuffed-mushroom-rolls/">Shutterbean</a> (and I’ll include my homemade pizza dough recipe from Curtis Stone’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Whats-Dinner-Delicious-Recipes-Busy/dp/0345542525">What’s For Dinner?</a>). </p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="3264" data-orig-width="2448"><img src="http://66.media.tumblr.com/d7454157e0f82a4f2870f7ead6a029d6/tumblr_inline_nx9omjcpWN1son4ik_540.jpg" data-orig-height="3264" data-orig-width="2448"/></figure><ul><li>1 pound pizza dough<br/></li><li>8 oz. sliced crimini mushrooms (about 3 cups)<br/></li><li>6 sprigs fresh thyme<br/></li><li>3 cloves chopped garlic<br/></li><li>1 cup freshly grated Parmesan, divided<br/></li><li>2 tablespoons butter, divided<br/></li><li>3 tablespoons chopped Italian parsley<br/></li><li>1 tablespoon olive oil<br/></li></ul><ol><li>Preheat oven to 450F. Spray a 12-cup muffin tin with cooking spray and set aside.  Place pizza dough on flour lined work surface and cut into 12 pieces.<br/></li><li>Heat a cast iron skillet over medium high heat and place mushrooms in pan until they start to soften, about 5 minutes. Stir in one tablespoon butter and chopped garlic. Pull the leaves from thyme sprigs and stir them into the mushroom mixture. Cook for another 2-3 minutes until garlic is softened. Season with salt and pepper and stir in &frac12; cup grated Parmesan cheese and two tablespoons chopped parsley. <i>[You might add the cheese to the mushroom mixture in a separate container because it will MELT INSTANTLY in the hot pan.]</i><br/></li><li>Grab a piece of pizza dough, flatten slightly in your hand and spoon about a tablespoon of the mushroom mixture into the center of the dough. Fold over the sides and place each stuffed dough piece into the prepared muffin tin.  <i>[There’s no “correct” way to roll these rolls. I sort of just pinched the edges together. The original recipe shows the creator sort of rolling the rolls and closing them in that way.]</i></li><li>Melt remaining tablespoon of butter in a small bowl. Brush the tops of each dough roll with a pastry brush and sprinkle 1-2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese onto the tops.  </li><li>Place muffin tin in the oven and bake until rolls are golden and brown, about 15-18 minutes. To serve, drizzle hot rolls with olive oil and sprinkle remaining chopped parsley on top.<br/></li></ol><p><b>Homemade Pizza Dough </b>(makes 2 balls of dough)</p><ul><li>1 &frac14; cup lukewarm water (110-115 degrees F<i>&ndash; but I just feel it out</i>)</li><li>2 teaspoons honey</li><li>1 packet (or 2 &frac14; tsps) active dry yeast</li><li>3 cups unbleached all purpose flour, plus more for dusting<br/></li><li>1 tsp fine sea salt</li><li>1 tbsp olive oil</li></ul><ol><li>In a small bowl, whisk lukewarm water, honey, and yeast to blend. Set aside for about 5 minutes, or until foamy. Stir to dissolve the yeast.<br/></li><li>In a food processor, pulse the flour and salt to combine. With the machine running, pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil and process until dough forms a ball. Transfer the dough to a work surface and knead for about 3 minutes, or until it is smooth and elastic. Do not add too much flour. The dough will be tacky but it should release cleanly from your hands.<br/></li><li>Divide the dough in half and gently form each half into a ball. Place on a floured rimmed baking sheet, and dust the tops with flour. Cover with plastic wrap. Let stand in a warm, draft free place for about 45 minutes, or until the dough doubles in volume. </li></ol>

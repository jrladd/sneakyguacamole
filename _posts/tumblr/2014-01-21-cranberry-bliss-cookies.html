<p>HOLIDAY GIFT PALOOZA PART 2: fruity cookies.</p>
<p>While I was fairly positive I took pictures of all my cookie creations, I can&rsquo;t find any but my caramels, so excuse the less colorful nature of these next few posts. Note: my cookies ended up looking like the recipe&rsquo;s pictures, YAY! Also, more than one person told me this was their favorite cookie, so it&rsquo;s a crowd pleaser.</p>

Quick dinner: leek pasta carbonara. Cook ½-1 lb of pasta. In a pan, fry some pancetta or a couple slices of bacon. Next, cut up a leek and fry, for about 4 minutes, then add two garlic cloves and cook another couple minutes. In a bowl, whisk two eggs, ½ a cup or more Parmesan, and about a half cup pasta water. Once this sauce is mixed, add pasta then bacon & leeks. YUM.

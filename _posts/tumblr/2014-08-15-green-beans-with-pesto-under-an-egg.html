<p>I&rsquo;ve never poached eggs before, and after reading multiple articles on how to best poach an egg, I combined multiple tips and methods: I added a little salt and about 2 tbsp of white vinegar to my water. I put the eggs in small mesh strainers to get rid of the runny part of the white, so it wouldn&rsquo;t spider web out, and slowly lowered them in. Was the poaching perfect? Nope, but it was a good first attempt. I think I&rsquo;ll try <a href="http://www.onlinecookingschool.com/eggs">America&rsquo;s Test Kitchen&rsquo;s approach</a> next time, maybe on <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/recipe-green-beans-with-almond-pesto-under-an-egg-for-breakfast-167172">this Kitchn recipe </a>again because it was SO tasty!</p>

<ul><li>Sea salt</li>
<li>&frac12; pound haricots verts or slender green beans, trimmed</li>
<li>pesto</li>
<li>eggs</li>
</ul><ol><li>
<p>Have ready a large bowl of ice water. Bring a large saucepan three-fourths full of generously salted water to a boil over high heat. Drop in the beans all at once and cook for 3 minutes. Drain and immediately plunge the beans into ice water. Set aside.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>If you want to make their recommended almond pesto (see the recipe above for the exact amount of ingredients):</i> In a food processor or blender, combine the garlic, parsley, and &frac12; teaspoon salt and process until the parsley is finely chopped. With the machine running, add the olive oil in a slow steady stream and process until a smooth purée forms. Add the almonds and pulse until finely chopped and the pesto is a uniform coarse purée. <i>[I just used pesto I already had fresh made&ndash;kale arugula pesto].</i></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drain the beans and pat dry. Put them in a large bowl, add the pesto, and toss to coat evenly. Arrange the beans on a serving platter or in a bowl and serve at room temperature. Serve with a poached egg, if desired.</p>

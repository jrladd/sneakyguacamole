A lovely Saturday morning breakfast. My fella tells me this Mario Batalli recipe is similar to a dish in his Italian American family. I served these eggs cooked in a spicy tomato sauce over cheesy grits. Mmmm. Via The Chew. 4 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil1 medium onion coarsely chopped6 cloves garlic thinly sliced4 jalapeño peppers seeded and cut into ¼ inch dice1 teaspoon hot chile flakes3 cup basic tomato sauce8 large eggs¼ grated Parmigiano Reggiano or PecorinoShredded basilSalt and pepperPlace a skillet, preferably cast iron, on the grill over medium-high heat. Add the oil and heat until just smoking.Add the chopped onion, garlic, jalapeños and chile flakes and cook until softened and light brown, about 7 minutes.Add the tomato sauce and bring to a boil. Immediately lower the heat to a simmer and carefully crack the eggs one by one into the tomato sauce. Season with salt and pepper.  Cook until as set as desired. I like it when the whites set but the yolks are still quite runny, about 5-6 minutes. [Remember that the eggs will continue to cook in the tomato sauce, even once you take the pan off heat. Therefore, unless dishing out immediately, don’t cook your eggs as much as you’d like, since it will cook more in the sauce.]Remove the pan from the heat and sprinkle with cheese and some shredded basil. Allow to cool 3-4 minutes.  Garnish with basil and serve.

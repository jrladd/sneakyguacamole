Easy weeknight dinner! FYI, when buying this meat, and asking for the amount of pork loin the recipe recommends, my butcher said just to buy a pork loin chop or cutlet; it’s generally the right size, rather than a much larger loin. Via Serious Eats.½ pound pork loin, sliced into strips less then a quarter inch thickKosher salt¼ teaspoon sugar1/8 teaspoon ground white pepper [I just used black pepper.]½ teaspoon Shaoxing wine [If you don’t have this, you can skip it or substitute white wine or apple cider vinegar which aren’t bad substitutes.]½ teaspoon soy sauce1 teaspoon plus 3 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided½ teaspoon cornstarch12 ounces string beans, ends trimmedOne (¼-inch) slice of fresh ginger4 medium cloves garlic, finely minced (about 4 teaspoons)Steamed white rice for servingPlace the pork in a large bowl. Add ¼ teaspoon salt, sugar, ground white pepper, Shaoxing wine, soy sauce, 1 teaspoon oil, and cornstarch. Mix well and transfer to refrigerator for 30 minutes. [I added a touch of Sriracha and fish sauce as well.]Meanwhile, bring 4 cups of salted water to a boil in a wok over high heat. Add the string beans and cook for 1 minute. Remove the strain beans to a colander and rinse under cold running water until cooled. Allow excess water to drain while pork marinates. Dry wok with paper towels.When ready to cook, heat 2 tablespoons of oil in the wok over high heat until smoking. Add the ginger. Cook for 30 seconds and then remove and discard the ginger. Add the pork and spread it out with in a single layer. Cook without moving until lightly browned, about 1 minute. Continue to cook, stirring, until almost cooked through, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.Heat remaining tablespoon oil over high heat until smoking. Shake off any excess water from the string beans and add them to the wok. [You want to cook them in the excess marinade and grease from the pork.] Season lightly with salt and cook, stirring, until tender, about 1 minute. Return pork to the wok and add the minced garlic. Cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Transfer to a serving platter immediately and serve with white rice.

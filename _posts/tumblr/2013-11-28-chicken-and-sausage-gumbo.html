<p>Gosh. I could eat gumbo everyday. For me, growing up Cajun, this is the ultimate comfort food. And it&rsquo;s perfect because you make a big pot and freeze most of it for later. While a little time consuming on the front end (it takes between a half hour and an hour to make a roux), it makes so much food that it&rsquo;s worth it.</p>
<p>This dish is brought to you by my Mother and her great cooking skills/guidance!</p>

<ul><li>
3 big cooking spoons vegetable oil
</li>
<li>
3 big cooking spoons flour

<p><i>(This is what I mean by a big cooking spoon. Like the kind you&rsquo;d get in a utensil set.)</i></p>

<ul><li>
2 cups chopped onions
</li>
<li>
1 cup chopped bell pepper
</li>
<li>
&frac12; cup celery
</li>
<li>
2 tablespoons garlic
</li>
<li>
5-6 cups chicken stock (like a big box of stock, 32 oz or more)
</li>
<li>
1-3 lbs cooked chicken <i>(depending on your preference, I usually put 2 big breasts)</i>
</li>
<li>
2 links smoked sausage
</li>
<li>
1 link andouille sausage 
</li>
<li>
Rice (to serve with) <i>(For John and I, one cup of rice is enough)</i>
</li>
</ul><p>
1. Make a roux. Add 3 big cooking spoons of vegetable oil, 3 big cooking spoons of flour to a large pot. Put it on medium low fire, cook slow and stir periodically for 30 minutes-ish. It should brown, like peanut butter color. It should be thick (like the consistency of stew)&ndash; not as thick as dough or anything, but also not watery. If it is, add more flour.

<p>This is what your roux should look like when it starts.</p>

<p>This is what your roux should look like when you&rsquo;re ready for the next step. You can make it darker if you choose, but I like it peanut butter colored.</p>
<p><b>**Big note: don&rsquo;t let it burn!! If it does, you have to start over. This step is the most important. I&rsquo;ve definitely burned it and had to start over&ndash; not fun. :)</b></p>
<p>2.Add 2 cups of chopped onion, 1 cup bell pepper, &frac12; cup celery, 2 tablespoons garlic. Medium low fire. Saute till onions are transparent (<i>about 5 mins</i>). (<b>Roux can still burn at this point&ndash; watch out!</b>)</p>

<p>3. Add chicken stock till at consistency you want (not watery, but a bit more watery than stew). Then add water later if its too thick. <i>My mother suggests that if you want your gumbo to be darker, add kitchen bouquet (about a cap full or more to make it darker, but it&rsquo;s just for coloring so don&rsquo;t worry if you can&rsquo;t find it at the store). I have never found kitchen bouquet in a store outside of </i><i>southeastern LA.</i></p><p>

4. Add cooked chicken as well as 2 links Bryan&rsquo;s smoked sausage and 1 link andouille sausage uncooked (cut into circle slices, then cut the circles in half).

5. Simmer for a while, 1-2 hours. Don&rsquo;t let it get too thick (if it&rsquo;s really coating your spoon, it&rsquo;s probably too thick). Then cool on the stove for an hour or so.

7. Cool in fridge uncovered (put a cover on it after it cools).

That&rsquo;s it! Gumbo is always better after its been in the fridge for a few days so feel free to prepare ahead! When you reheat and serve, if it&rsquo;s too thick, just add water. This serves about 5-6 people.

</p><p><b>YUM.</b></p>

What I got was obviously canned beans. I hate to be a food snob but&hellip; Ew. This is my veggie hierarchy:  Fresh (and preferably in season) first. Then frozen, because fresh, in season veggies are blanched then frozen so it keeps well. Canned? No thanks, unless it&rsquo;s tomatoes or something home canned/pickled.</p>

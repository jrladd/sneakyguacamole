Ok, I should start by saying– this dish was WAY to salty. I’ve always preferred salty to sweet, but this was even too salty for me! However, it did taste good, and I love all the recipe’s parts–olives, capers. cheese– so I recommend it, but I would cut all the salty ingredients by HALF at least. Taste as you go and see. Via Bon Appetit.Remember, I would recommend cutting all the salty parts (anchovy, olives, capers, cheese) by half! Or doing a full pound of pasta may spread out the saltiness.1 tablespoon plus ½ cup olive oil¼ cup panko (Japanese breadcrumbs)Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest12 ounces linguine or other long pasta4 oil-packed anchovy fillets [I used 1 tsp anchovy paste.]1 small garlic clove1 cup chopped fresh parsley½ cup chopped fresh basil1 cup green olives, pitted, halved3 tablespoons drained capers½ ounce Parmesan, finely grated (about ½ cup), plus more for serving2 tablespoons fresh lemon juiceHeat 1 tablespoon oil in a medium skillet over medium and cook panko, stirring, until golden, about 5 minutes. [Watch carefully so it doesn’t burn– mine was ready in less than 5 minutes.] Season with salt and pepper; transfer to paper towels to drain and toss with dill and lemon zest.Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until al dente. Drain, reserving ½ cup pasta cooking liquid.Meanwhile, mash anchovies and garlic to a paste on a cutting board with the side of a chef’s knife. Combine with parsley, basil, and half of olives and capers in a large bowl. Chop remaining olives and capers and add to bowl, along with remaining ½ cup oil. Mix well; season sauce with salt and pepper.Add pasta and ¼ cup reserved pasta cooking liquid to sauce. Toss, adding Parmesan a bit at a time, along with more pasta cooking liquid as needed, until sauce coats pasta. Add lemon juice; season with salt and pepper.Serve pasta topped with panko and more Parmesan.

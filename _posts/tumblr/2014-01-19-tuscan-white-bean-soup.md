This is one of my go to weekday recipes. Nommy quick soup. Oh yes. This recipe is brought to you by busy schedules and Serious Eats.
My picture looks a little funny because I didn’t have any kale; I just threw in some parsley for some pretty greenness.
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving
1 medium onion, finely diced (about 1 cup)
2 medium carrots, finely diced (about 1 cup)
2 ribs celery, finely diced (about 1 cup)
4 cloves garlic, minced 
½ teaspoon dried red pepper flakes
1 quart homemade or low-sodium canned chicken broth
2 (15-ounce) cans white beans (cannellini or great northern)
4 6-inch sprigs rosemary, leaves finely chopped and stems reserved
1 (3-4 inch) chunk parmesan rind (optional) [I was able to buy parmesan rinds for cheap at my Whole Foods. Just store them in your freezer.]
2 bay leaves
3 to 4 cups roughly chopped kale or swiss chard leaves
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
Parmigiano-Reggiano for serving
* Also, I always add chorizo to this recipe, and I find it really adds something extra. So what I do is take 1-2 links of chorizo (¼ to ½ lb or more if you want), take it out of its casing (if it’s cased, you can also get bulk, ground chorizo), and brown it. When finished, pat it down and set it to the side. Then add it to the soup after you’ve pulsed the soup a few times with your immersion blender.
1. Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onions, carrots, and celery and cook, stirring frequently, until softened but not browned, about 3 minutes. Add garlic and dried red pepper flakes and cook, stirring constantly until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add chicken broth, beans and their liquid, rosemary stems, parmesan rind, and bay leaves. Increase heat to high, and bring to a boil. Reduce to a bare simmer, add kale, cover and cook for 15 minutes.
2. Discard the bay leaves and rosemary stems. Use a hand blender to roughly puree part of the beans until desired consistency is reached. Alternatively, transfer 2 cups of soup to a blender or food processor and process until smooth (start on low speed and increase to high to prevent blender blow-out). Return to the soup and stir to combine. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
3. Ladle into bowls, sprinkle with reserved chopped rosemary leaves, drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil and a grating of Parmigiano-Reggiano, and serve with crusty toasted bread.

NOM.

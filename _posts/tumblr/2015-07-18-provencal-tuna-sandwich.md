This is one of those recipes that seem to have a lot of steps, and you wonder if it will really be worth it … IT IS. Amazing treat to bring to an outside event, like Shakespeare in the Park! New summer staple. Via Food and Wine.2 teaspoons fennel seeds [if you have it, I didn’t and left this out, and felt it was still fennel-y enough]¾ cup mayonnaise¼ cup crème fraîche [if you have it. It will add some tangy-ness. You could also substitute sour cream or just do mayo.]1 garlic clove, finely chopped1 medium fennel bulb, shaved paper-thin, plus 2 tablespoons chopped fronds [I used my mandolin to shave the fennel, or you could just slice carefully with a knife.]1 tablespoon finely grated lemon zest plus 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juiceKosher saltBlack pepper¼ cup finely chopped red onion¼ cup pitted Niçoise olives, chopped [I couldn’t find Nicoise olives, so I substituted kalamata.]2 tablespoons capers, chopped1 teaspoon crushed red pepperTwo 6-ounces jars tuna packed in olive oil, drained and flaked2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil1 baguette, halved lengthwise2 cups arugula (2 ounces)2 medium tomatoes, thinly sliced½ English cucumber, thinly sliced12 white anchovy fillets I only dressed mine with arugula and left off the tomatoes, cucumber, and anchovy. Do whatever you want!In a small skillet, toast the fennel seeds over moderately low heat until golden,  3 minutes. Finely crush them in a mortar. [optional step, see above.]In a food processor, mix the fennel seeds with the mayonnaise, crème fraîche, garlic, fennel fronds, 2 teaspoons of the lemon zest and 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice; puree. Season with salt and black pepper.In a bowl, mix the onion, olives, capers, crushed red pepper and the remaining 1 teaspoon of lemon zest and 2 tablespoons of lemon juice. Fold in the tuna and olive oil.Spread the fennel mayo on the cut sides of the baguette. Arrange the arugula on the bottom baguette and top with the shaved fennel and the tuna. Layer the tomatoes, cucumber and anchovies on top. Close the baguette and cut into 4 sandwiches.MAKE AHEADThe fennel mayonnaise can be refrigerated for 3 days. The sandwiches can be wrapped in parchment paper and kept in the fridge for 4 hours.

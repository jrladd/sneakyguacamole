A great on-the-good breakfast option for the beginning of the school year! Via Southern Living. 1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour1 tablespoon baking powder½ teaspoon table salt1/8 teaspoon ground red pepper4 thick bacon slices, cooked and crumbled1 cup peeled and diced Granny Smith apple (about 1 small apple) ¾ cup (6 oz.) shredded extra-sharp Cheddar cheese ½ cup toasted chopped pecans1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh rosemary3 large eggs 1/3 cup milk 1/3 cup canola oil Shortening1. Preheat oven to 350°. Whisk together flour and next 3 ingredients in a large bowl until thoroughly combined. Stir together bacon and next 4 ingredients in a medium bowl. Whisk together eggs, milk, and oil in a small bowl.2. Add egg mixture to flour mixture, and stir just until dry ingredients are moistened; stir in bacon mixture just until incorporated. Transfer dough to a greased (with shortening) and floured 8 ½- x 4 ½-inch loaf pan.3. Bake at 350° for 55 minutes to 1 hour or until a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean, shielding bread with aluminum foil after 40 to 45 minutes to prevent excessive browning. Cool bread in pan on a wire rack 10 minutes. Remove from pan, and cool 30 minutes before slicing.

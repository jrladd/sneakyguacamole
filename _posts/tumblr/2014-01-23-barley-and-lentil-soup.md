So, before the polar vortex, I made a pit stop at the grocery store, but following the worst of it, it was just too cold and snowy to go outside. Pshaw. Therefore, eventually, I had to scrape the bottom of the barrel in our home. Happily, this recipe is made with many staples we always keep around! Thanks to Real Simple for this weather, brought to you by the polar vortex (BOO!). 
2 tablespoons canola oil
6 scallions, chopped, white and green parts separated
4 cloves garlic, chopped
1 tablespoon finely chopped ginger (I had no fresh, so I used powder. Generally for any tbsp fresh, use one tsp dried).
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1 1/2 tablespoons curry powder
1 13.5-ounce can coconut milk
1 cup dried red lentils
1 cup pearl barley
kosher salt
1 cup yogurt (I had no yogurt, so I just popped a bit of ricotta on top for the smoothness and to cut the spice)
Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the scallion whites, garlic, and ginger. Cook, stirring frequently, until soft, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the tomato paste and curry powder. Cook, stirring, until the tomato paste darkens, 1 to 2 minutes.
Add the coconut milk, lentils, barley, 4 cups water, and ½ teaspoon salt and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the lentils and barley are tender, 35 to 45 minutes (adding more water if needed to loosen).
Serve topped with the scallion greens and yogurt.
NOM.

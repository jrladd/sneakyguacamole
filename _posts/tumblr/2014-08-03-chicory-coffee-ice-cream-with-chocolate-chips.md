One of my goals this summer is learning to make ice cream, and this second attempt was a GREAT success! Note: once you make ice cream in a maker, like my Cuisinart freezer bowl kind, it comes out like soft serve and must be frozen in a freezer safe container for a few more hours to gain that true ice cream consistency. I’ve realized freezer safe ball jars are the perfect container because then John and I can get our own, personal pints of ice cream! More attempts to follow …



This coffee ice cream recipe comes from an amazing ice cream book: Sweet Cream and Sugar Cones. I just substituted Cafe du Monde chicory coffee for regular to get that strong coffee taste. 
1 ¾ cups heavy cream
¾ cup 1% or 2% milk (I used whole milk which was what I had)
½ cup sugar
¼ cup finely ground coffee
¼ tsp kosher salt
5 large egg yolks
½ cup chocolate chips (optional)
Infuse the milk/cream
In a heavy saucepan, stir together the cream, milk, half the sugar (¼ coffee), coffee, and salt.
Put the pan over medium-high heat. When the mixture just begins to bubble around the edges, remove the heat and cover the pan. Let steep for about 10 minutes, or until the cream has taken on a strong coffee flavor. (Stir occasionally and taste it to monitor the progress.)
Make the base
In a medium heatproof bowl, whisk the yolks just to break them up, then whisk in the remaining half of the sugar (¼ cup). Uncover the cream mixture and put the pan over medium heat. 
Carefully scoop out about ½ cup of the hot cream mixture and, whisking the eggs constantly, add the cream to the bowl with the egg yolks. Repeat, adding another ½ cup of the hot cream to the bowl with the yolks. Using a heatproof rubber spatula, stir the cream in the saucepan as you slowly pour the egg-and-cream mixture from the bowl into the pan.
Cook the mixture carefully over medium heat, stirring constantly, until it is thickened, coats the back of a spatula, and holds a clear path when you run your finger across the spatula (3 minutes longer).
Strain the base through a fine-mesh strainer into a clean container. (It should still have specks of coffee grinds in it, so don’t worry!) Set the container into an ice-water bath, wash your spatula, and use it to stir the base occasionally until it is cool. Remove the container from the ice-water bath, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate the base for at least two hours or overnight.
Freeze the cream 




Freeze in your ice cream machine according to the manufactorer’s instructions. (If you want to add chocolate chips like me, pour them in when your churning time is down to about 10 minutes.) While the ice cream is churning, put the container you’ll use to store the ice cream into the freezer. Enjoy right away or, for a firmer ice cream, transfer to the chilled container and freeze for at least 4 hours.

<p>Om nom nom! We sadly don’t have many delivery Asian food joints here, so this serves as a pretty easy and delicious alternative! Via <a href="http://www.healthy-delicious.com/spicy-garlic-noodles-with-pork/">Healthy Delicious</a>.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="3264" data-orig-width="2448"><img src="http://66.media.tumblr.com/2bcb3ccded69c94658635dd4330acf13/tumblr_inline_o4wzephHC41son4ik_540.jpg" data-orig-height="3264" data-orig-width="2448"/></figure><ul><li>16 ounces udon noodles</li><li>1 cup chicken stock</li><li>¼ cup low sodium soy sauce</li><li>2 tablespoons rice vinegar</li><li>2-3 tablespoons sambal oelek (chili paste)</li><li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li><li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li><li>4 large garlic cloves, minced (about 3 tablespoons)</li><li>1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger</li><li>1 pound lean ground pork</li><li>2 pieces baby bok choy, cut into quarters</li><li>4 scallions, sliced</li></ul><ol><li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook the udon noodles according to the directions on the package. Drain.</li><li>Meanwhile, in a small bowl, mix the chicken stock, soy sauce, vinegar, samba olek, and sesame oil. Set aside.</li><li>Heat the olive oil in a large sauté pan set over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and cook 2-3 minutes, or until it begins to soften. Stir in the ginger and cook 1 minute. Add the pork and cook for 5 minutes, or until nearly cooked through. Pour off and discard and liquid that has accumulated in the pan.</li><li>Push the pork to one side of the pan and add the bok choy to the other side. Cook 2-3 minutes, until the bok choy begins to wilt. Reduce the heat to medium and add the sauce. Cover and cook 3-5 minutes, or until the pork and bok choy are cooked through.</li><li>Mix in the cooked udon noodles and top with scallions.</li></ol><blockquote><p>Also, an obvious note, but feel free to substitute and adjust! I didn’t have any bok choy on hand, so I used kale. No sambal oelek? Just use a tablespoon or two of sriracha and sprinkle your desired amount of red chili pepper flakes. You can do it!</p></blockquote>

What happens when it’s finals season and you have no food except for leftovers from a graduate reading group? You make it work. Via Food and Wine.I only had 5 oz of brie left over so I made a half recipe and made up for the 1 oz of brie by adding about ¼ cup of grated Parmesan. I also added a bit more pasta (more like 8 oz, rather than the ½ recipe amount of 6 oz). Lastly, though the sauce looked a bit thick, it coated the pasta well and was yummmmyyy.4 ounces sliced bacon, cut into 1-inch strips [I cooked my bacon then crumbled it rather than pre-slicing it.]1 medium onion, thinly sliced [I diced it.]1 tablespoon all-purpose flour1 cup whole milk12 ounces Brie, rind removed, cheese cut into 1-inch chunks12 ounces fusilliSalt and freshly ground pepper3 tablespoons freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheesePreheat the broiler and position a rack 6 inches from the heat. In a deep, medium skillet, cook the bacon over moderately high heat until browned and crisp, about 6 minutes. Drain the bacon on paper towels and discard all but 1 tablespoon of the fat in the skillet. Add the onion to the skillet and cook over moderate heat, stirring, until softened and lightly browned, about 6 minutes. Add the flour and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the milk and whisk until the sauce is thickened and bubbling, about 3 minutes. Turn off the heat and stir in the Brie until completely melted. [For me, my brie wouldn’t melt til I put the sauce back on heat, but then it only took a minute or two on low heat.] Meanwhile, in a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the fusilli until al dente; drain well. Add the fusilli to the sauce in the skillet and toss. Add the bacon and season with salt and pepper. Transfer the pasta to an 8-inch baking dish and sprinkle the Parmigiano-Reggiano on top. Broil for 5 minutes, until the cheese is golden, shifting the pan for even browning. [I added panko bread crumbs for a crunch and that browned much more quickly– 2-3 minutes?]EAT!

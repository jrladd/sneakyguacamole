A necessity recipe– when you’ve got nothing in the fridge! I pulled from these two recipes to make this concoction: Serious Eats and GimmeSomeOven.½ lb. (8 oz.) pasta (preferably a spaghetti-like shape)4-6 strips bacon, finely sliced½ lb. (8 oz.) fresh asparagus, ends trimmed and cut into 2-inch pieces¼ cup dry white wine (or you can double this if you’d like)½ cup grated or flaked Parmesan cheese1 tablespoon juice and 1 teaspoon zest from 1 lemon (if have)1 tablespoon unsalted butterSalt and pepperBring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add asparagus and cook until just tender but still bright green, about 2 minutes. Transfer to an ice bath to chill. Dry and set aside. Keep water on stove for pasta, and cook the pasta in a large pot of salted water al dente according to package instructions. Set aside a ¼ of your pasta water when draining pasta.Add bacon to a large saucepan or dutch oven and set over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring frequently, until bacon is crisp and rendered, about 5 minutes. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon and set aside. Add asparagus to the pan and saute in the bacon grease for about 5-6 minutes, stirring occasionally, until cooked. Remove asparagus with a slotted spoon, and set aside with the bacon. Slowly add the white wine to the pan, and scape the bottom of the pan with a spoon to deglaze the pan and pick up all of those yummy brown bits. Continue cooking for 5 minutes, or until the wine has reduced by about half. Add lemon juice and zest, butter, and plenty of black pepper. Stir until butter is melted.When the pasta is cooked, drain it. Then add the pasta, asparagus, bacon and ¼ cup Parmesan cheese to the saute pan, and toss until combined. If the pasta seems too dry, add in the pasta water a bit at a time and toss to combine, until desired consistency is reached.Sprinkle pasta with the remaining Parmesan cheese and serve immediately.

Add the barley, reduced heat to low, cover, and simmer until the barley is tender, about 45 minutes. Drain in a coarse-mesh sieve.Meanwhile, season the chicken with the rosemary, ½ tsp salt, and ½ tsp pepper. In a large, heavy ovenproof pot, warm the oil over medium-high heat. Add the chicken thighs, skin side down, and cook, turning once, until golden brown, 8-10 minutes total. Transfer the chicken to a plate.Pour off all but 1 tbsp fat from the pan and add the celery, yellow onion, garlic, and pine nuts. Saute until the vegetables are soft, about 2 minutes. Stir in the barley, mushrooms, and broth. Adjust the seasoning, and return the chicken to the pot.Bake, uncovered, until the mushrooms are tender and the chicken meat slips easily from the bones, 15-20 minutes. During last 5 minutes, sprinkle with the green onions. Serve directly from the pot.

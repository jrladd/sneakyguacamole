<p>Another attempt at meat from Curtis Stone&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Whats-Dinner-Delicious-Recipes-Busy/dp/0345542525"><i>What&rsquo;s for Dinner?</i></a>. I liked this a lot more than my first attempt at flank steak. I think the key was cutting the steak in half horizontally so it wasn&rsquo;t as thick, pounding it a bit, then marinating. </p>
<p>While his recipe has instructions for constructing the taco, I&rsquo;ll focus in this post on how to cook the steak.</p>
<ul><li>&frac12; cup finely chopped fresh cilantro</li>
<li>&frac14; cup packed dark brown sugar</li>
<li>3 tbsp canola oil</li>
<li>3 tbsp soy sauce</li>
<li>1 tbsp toasted sesame oil</li>
<li>2 large garlic cloves, minced</li>
<li>1 jalapeño pepper, seeded and finely chopped</li>
<li>1 tsp black pepper</li>
<li>1 tsp ground coriander</li>
<li>1 2 lb flank steak, about 1 &frac12; inches thick, fat trimmed <i>(the Whole Foods butcher trimmed the fat and I made my steak thinner by choice)</i></li>
</ul><ol><li>To marinate the steak: In a large baking dish, whisk the cilantro, brown sugar, canola oil, soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic, jalapeño, black pepper, and coriander to blend well. Reserve &frac14; cup of the mixture in a small bowl for serving. Place the steak in the remaining marinade and turn to coat. Marinate for at least 20 minutes at room temperature, or cover and refrigerate for up to 1 day, turning occasionally. Cover and refrigerate the reserved marinade. <img src="http://66.media.tumblr.com/fc7ace1130244a2a6e305b03eb989f1a/tumblr_inline_n8qag9S89D1son4ik.jpg" alt="image"/></li>
<li>Prepare an outdoor grill for medium high cooking over direct heat.</li>
<li>Remove the steak from the marinade (discard the marinade) and grill, turning halfway through cooking, for a total of 10 minutes, until the meat feels only slightly resilient when pressed with a fingertip for medium-rare.<i> [Mine needed less time because it was thinner. I still cooked mine more through then I may have liked, but it takes practice.] </i>Transfer steak to cutting board and let rest 5-10 minutes.<img src="http://66.media.tumblr.com/df24963b4c4ce09e79cf1b0c4e13c1c2/tumblr_inline_n8qam2o22c1son4ik.jpg" alt="image"/></li>
<li>Cut the steak across the grain into &frac14; inch thick slices. Serve the steak with reserved marinade.</li>

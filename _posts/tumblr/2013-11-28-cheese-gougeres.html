<p>Oh my goodness. These are so light, so airy, so cheesy, so all the things.</p>
<p>This is brought to you by my recent experimentation with breads, Jacques Pepin, and <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2006/12/just-a-few-bites/">Smitten Kitchen</a>!</p>

<ul><li>1 cup milk</li>
<li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter (&frac12; stick)</li>
<li>&frac14; teaspoon salt</li>
<li>Dash cayenne pepper</li>
<li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
<li>3 large eggs</li>
<li>&frac12; teaspoon paprika</li>
<li>&frac12; cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
<li>1 &frac12; cups grated Swiss cheese (Emmenthaler or Gruyere)<i>&ndash; I used Emmenthaler</i></li>
<li>Coarse salt (fleur de sel or kosher salt) to sprinkle on top</li>
</ul><p>Bring the milk, butter, salt, and cayenne to a boil in a saucepan. Remove from the heat, add the flour all at once, and mix vigorously with a wooden spatula until the mixture forms a ball. Return the pan to the heat and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for about 1 minute to dry the mixture a bit. Transfer to the bowl of a food processor, let cool for 5 minutes, then process for about 5 seconds. <i>I don&rsquo;t have a big enough food processor, so following the advice of <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-cheese-gougres-169039">this article from The Kitchn</a>, I used a mixer for this step and to add the eggs.</i></p>
<p>Add the eggs and paprika to the processor bowl, and process for 10 to 15 seconds, until well mixed. Transfer the choux paste to a mixing bowl, and let cool for 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Preheat the oven to 375°F. Line a cookie sheet with a reusable nonstick baking mat or parchment paper. Reserve 1 tablespoon of the grated Parmesan cheese, then add the remainder and all the Swiss cheese to the choux paste. Stir just enough to incorporate. Using a tablespoon, scoop out a level tablespoon of the gougère dough, and push it off the spoon onto the cooking mat. Continue making individual gougère, spacing them about 2-inches apart on the sheet. Sprinkle a few grains of coarse salt and a little of the reserved Parmesan cheese on each gougère. Bake for about 30 minutes, until nicely browned and crisp. Serve lukewarm or at room temperature with drinks. <i>If you&rsquo;re not serving them immediately, I would leave off the coarse salt, because it will make the gougeres soggy. Also, to store, put in an airtight container and pop in the oven before serving.</i></p>
<p>Surprisingly fast and easy; enjoy!</p>
<p>YUM!</p>

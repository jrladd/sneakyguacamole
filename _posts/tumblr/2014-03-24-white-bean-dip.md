Great party snack from my Oscars party! via Food Network

2 cloves garlic
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1/3 cup olive oil
Â¼ cup (loosely packed) fresh Italian parsley leaves
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
Place the beans, garlic, lemon juice, 1/3 cup olive oil, and parsley in the work bowl of a food processor. Pulse until the mixture is coarsely chopped. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Transfer the bean puree to a small bowl.

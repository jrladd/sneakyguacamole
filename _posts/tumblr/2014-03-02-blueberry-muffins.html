<p>Of course, I fail with the pictures again. [<i>Picture update!</i>] I think when I&rsquo;m baking things for other people, I just space out. I made <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2010/08/perfect-blueberry-muffins/">these muffins</a> for my book club that I run for the library I work for. They were a great accompaniment to our book <i>Wild</i> by Cheryl Strayed (check it out!). </p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="3264" data-orig-width="2448"><img src="http://67.media.tumblr.com/625e1dc18a3d34f1565fe903e644afdb/tumblr_inline_o89smxU7yB1son4ik_540.jpg" data-orig-height="3264" data-orig-width="2448"/></figure><p>Makes 9 to 10 standard muffins <i>(for me, it made 12)</i></p>
<ul><li>5 tablespoons (2 &frac12; ounces or 71 grams) unsalted butter , softened</li>
<li>&frac12; cup (3 &frac12; ounces or 100 grams) sugar</li>
<li>1 large egg</li>
<li>&frac34; cup sour cream or plain yogurt <i>(I used plain Greek yogurt)</i></li>
<li>&frac12; teaspoon grated lemon zest <i>(I&rsquo;ve made this recipe with and without the zest, but if you have it, add it! It makes a difference. But it is also delicious without, so don&rsquo;t run to the store just for this)</i></li>
<li>1 &frac12; cups (6 &frac34; ounces or 191 grams) all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1 &frac12; teaspoon (7 grams or &frac14; ounce) baking powder</li>
<li>&frac14; teaspoon (1 gram) baking soda</li>
<li>&frac14; teaspoon (2 grams) salt</li>
<li>&frac34; cup (3 &frac34; ounces or 105 grams) blueberries, fresh or frozen (if frozen, don’t bother defrosting)</li>
</ul><ol><li>Preheat oven to 375°F. Line a muffin tin with 10 paper liners or spray each cup with a nonstick spray. </li>
<li>Beat butter and sugar with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add egg and beat well, then yogurt and zest. </li>
<li>Put flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt into a sifter and sift half of dry ingredients over batter. Mix until combined. Sift remaining dry ingredients into batter and mix just until the flour disappears. </li>
<li>Gently fold in your blueberries. The dough will be quite thick (and even thicker, if you used a full-fat Greek-style yogurt), closer to a cookie dough, which is why an ice cream scoop is a great tool to fill your muffin cups. You’re looking for them to be about &frac34; full, nothing more, so you might only need 9 instead of 10 cups. </li>
<li>Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until tops are golden and a tester inserted into the center of muffins comes out clean (you know, except for blueberry goo). Let cool on rack (ha), or you know, serve with a generous pat of butter.</li>

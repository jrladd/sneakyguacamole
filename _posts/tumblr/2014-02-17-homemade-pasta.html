<p>Around Christmas time I went to TJ Maxx for the first time and was rewarded with a super affordable pasta maker! </p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always wanted to make homemade pasta, so here was my chance. I picked up the book, <i>Making Artisan Pasta</i> by Aliza Green from my local library and had at it.</p>
<p>Pasta Flour Mix:</p>
<ul><li>&frac12; lb unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
<li>&frac14; lb durum flour</li>
<li>&frac14; lb semolina flour</li>
</ul><p><i>*Note: I couldn&rsquo;t easily find durum flour, so I went with &frac12; all purpose and &frac12; semolina. When I went to my local Italian market, they had coarse and fine semolina flour&ndash; I went with the fine. If you can&rsquo;t find semolina, no big. For example, the mint tagliatelle that I made on Valentines day&ndash; the Batali recipe calls for strictly all purpose flour (though I once again did &frac12; and &frac12;) so I think you&rsquo;re cool if all you can get is all purpose flour.</i></p>
<p>Basic Egg Pasta Dough </p>
<p><i>*This is the version if you&rsquo;re using a food processor. If you don&rsquo;t have a good food processor (which I didn&rsquo;t until about 2 months ago), you can find how to make egg pasta by hand on line, or there&rsquo;s a good description in my mint tagliatelle post as well.</i></p>
<ul><li>&frac34; lb pasta flour mix</li>
<li>3 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
<li>1 egg yolk</li>
<li>2-3 tbsp tepid water</li>
<li><i>you can also add about 1 tbsp olive oil as well if you like</i></li>
</ul><ol><li>Place the flour in the bowl of a food processor. In a small bowl or measuring cup, lightly beat together the eggs and water.</li>
<li>Start adding the liquid to the flour through the pouring spout with the machine running. The dough will start to form in moist clumps.</li>
<li>Continue adding liquid and processing until the mixture comes together to form a rough mass. Stop the machine at this point because you might burn out the motor if you continue.</li>
<li>Remove the dough from the food processor and transfer to a work surface, preferably wood. <i>(I didn&rsquo;t have wood and it was fine!)</i></li>
<li>Dust the board lightly with flour and knead the dough until it is cohesive and moderately smooth, about 5 minutes. (<i>Youtubing videos on how to knead helps. This Giuliano Hazan video helped me:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8wgXoPDnXQ.) </i>Running the dough through the pasta sheeter will develop the gluten further, making it smooth and elastic.</li>
<li>Cover the dough with a bowl, a damp towel, or plastic wrap and allow it to rest at room temperature for 30 minutes to relax the dough before proceeding with rolling.</li>
</ol><p>Now once I rolled and cut my pasta dough (once again, Youtube is a dream&ndash; for example: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oc_PBy-orXE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oc_PBy-orXE</a>), I needed to make something with it! In this case, based on what was in my fridge, I decided to make <a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/900634/pasta-asparagus-and-scrambled-eggs">Spaghetti with Asparagus and Scrambled Eggs.</a> Sounded totally weird but was surprisingly tasty.</p>

<ul><li>Coarse salt and ground pepper</li>
<li>&frac34; pound spaghetti <i>(or in this case, my fresh pasta!)</i></li>
<li>1 pound asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1 &frac12;-inch pieces</li>
<li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
<li>2 ounces Parmesan, grated (&frac12; cup), plus more for serving</li>
<li>5 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
<li>&frac14; cup part-skim ricotta</li>
</ul><ol><li>
<p>In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta 1 minute less than package instructions. Add asparagus and cook 1 minute. Reserve &frac12; cup pasta water, then drain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in pot over medium-high and add &frac14; cup pasta water. Add pasta mixture and Parmesan and cook, stirring, 1 minute. If necessary, add remaining pasta water to create a light sauce that coats pasta.</b>
</li>
<li>
<b>In a small nonstick skillet, melt 1 tablespoon butter over medium. Add eggs and cook, stirring, until just set. <i>(I did just three eggs, but it&rsquo;s up to you.)</i> Divide pasta and eggs among four plates, top with ricotta, and season with salt and pepper.</b>
</li>
</ol>

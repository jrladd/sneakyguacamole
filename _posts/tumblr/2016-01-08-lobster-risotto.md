Who doesn’t want to try to make lobster?! Unfortunately we live on paltry grad student stipends. However, my parents received lobster tails from my sister’s in-laws, so they let me run free and try things out. Since it was Christmas Eve, and Christmas is my mom’s birthday, I tried to plan a dish she would love, and she LOVES risotto! And while this recipe seemed a little unusual (mascarpone rather than parmesan?!), it was really creamy and the sweetness of the mascarpone matched the lobster’s sweetness. Via Saveur.6 cups chicken stock3 tbsp. olive oil3 medium shallots, minced2 cloves garlic, minced2 cups arborio rice1/3 cup dry white wine½ cup mascarpone1 lb. Maine lobster meat, cut into 1" pieces [This was 5 lobster tails for us. I just steamed the tails in their shells for about 2-3 minutes. This just partially cooked the tails; when I removed them from their shells, they were partially translucent. I knew they would finish cooking in the hot risotto–which they did!]½ cup frozen peas3 tbsp. unsalted butter1 tbsp. fresh lemon juice, plus 1 tsp. zest¼ cup chopped sorrel, plus more for garnish [We couldn’t get sorrel, so rather than substitute this amount of another green which would lack the lemoniness of the sorrel, I just added a handful of Italian parsley.]Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to tasteHeat chicken stock in a small saucepan over medium heat; set aside and keep warm. Heat oil in a 4-qt. saucepan over medium-high heat; add shallots and garlic to saucepan. Cook, stirring, until soft, 3 minutes. Add rice; cook until opaque, 3–4 minutes. Add wine; cook until absorbed, 1–2 minutes. Add reserved stock 1⁄2 cup at a time, cooking until each addition is absorbed before adding next amount. Cook, stirring often, until liquid has all been used and rice is tender, about 30 minutes. Add mascarpone and cook, stirring, until liquid is creamy, about 3 minutes more. Remove from heat and stir in lobster meat, peas, butter, lemon juice and zest, sorrel, salt, and pepper. Garnish with remaining sorrel and lemon zest, if you like.

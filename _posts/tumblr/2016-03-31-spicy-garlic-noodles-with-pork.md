Om nom nom! We sadly don’t have many delivery Asian food joints here, so this serves as a pretty easy and delicious alternative! Via Healthy Delicious.16 ounces udon noodles1 cup chicken stock¼ cup low sodium soy sauce2 tablespoons rice vinegar2-3 tablespoons sambal oelek (chili paste)1 tablespoon sesame oil1 tablespoon olive oil4 large garlic cloves, minced (about 3 tablespoons)1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger1 pound lean ground pork2 pieces baby bok choy, cut into quarters4 scallions, slicedBring a large pot of water to a boil and cook the udon noodles according to the directions on the package. Drain.Meanwhile, in a small bowl, mix the chicken stock, soy sauce, vinegar, samba olek, and sesame oil. Set aside.Heat the olive oil in a large sauté pan set over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and cook 2-3 minutes, or until it begins to soften. Stir in the ginger and cook 1 minute. Add the pork and cook for 5 minutes, or until nearly cooked through. Pour off and discard and liquid that has accumulated in the pan.Push the pork to one side of the pan and add the bok choy to the other side. Cook 2-3 minutes, until the bok choy begins to wilt. Reduce the heat to medium and add the sauce. Cover and cook 3-5 minutes, or until the pork and bok choy are cooked through.Mix in the cooked udon noodles and top with scallions.Also, an obvious note, but feel free to substitute and adjust! I didn’t have any bok choy on hand, so I used kale. No sambal oelek? Just use a tablespoon or two of sriracha and sprinkle your desired amount of red chili pepper flakes. You can do it!

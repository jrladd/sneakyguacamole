<p>Hey guys! Sadly, I couldn&rsquo;t go to Thanksgiving with my family this year. Super let down, because, for those who don&rsquo;t know, we have about 25-30+ people stuffed into my house and more food than most buffet lines. Also, my family is craze. There&rsquo;s often stories of my aunt giving my grandmother an enema, my cousins shooting bow and arrows in the backyard, and drawings for our pet secret santa. It&rsquo;s the bomb dot com. BUT I did have the first annual pajama fest with John and Cardigan today, which was AMAZE. And since I love to cook, I figured if I couldn&rsquo;t go home, I&rsquo;d go all out this year. Therefore, several posts will follow this one showing my multiple day cooking fest; our menu included:</p>
<ul><li>Cheese Gougeres</li>
<li>Chicken and Sausage Gumbo</li>
<li>Soy and Ginger Lacquered Cornish Hens</li>
<li>Homemade Green Bean Casserole</li>
<li>Cheddar Jalapeno Mashed Potatoes</li>
<li>Pumpkin Pie, with homemade whipped cream</li>
<li>Salted Caramel Chocolate Pecan Pie</li>
</ul><p>YAY!</p>

<p>Grab some bok choy at your local farmer’s market and try this out! I love how crunchy bok choy is, and how diverse it is&ndash; you can cook it in stir fries or curries, slice it and eat it raw in salad, etc!

When it shimmers, add garlic, then bok choy, and stir-fry for 2 minutes. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons water to the skillet or wok, then cover it and allow to cook for 2 to 3 minutes more, until bok choy has softened nicely at its base. <i>[I didn’t want to have my sauce too diluted, since not all the water cooks away, so I used about 1 tbsp water and 1 tbsp of the sauce in this step Since I served my bok choy over rice, I find more sauce, or less diluted sauce, adds flavor to the rice.]</i></li><li>Remove bok choy from the skillet or wok and place it on a warmed platter. Drizzle the reserved sauce over the greens and serve.</li></ol>

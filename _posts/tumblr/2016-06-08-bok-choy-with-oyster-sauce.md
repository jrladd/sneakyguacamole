Grab some bok choy at your local farmer’s market and try this out! I love how crunchy bok choy is, and how diverse it is– you can cook it in stir fries or curries, slice it and eat it raw in salad, etc! Via NYT Recipes.1 tablespoon soy sauce3 ½ tablespoons oyster sauce Pinch of sugar2 tablespoons rice vinegar (do not use seasoned rice vinegar)1 tablespoon neutral oil (like canola or vegetable)1 tablespoon finely minced garlic4 to 6 bunches of baby bok choy, approximately 1 ½ pounds, cleaned, with ends trimmed [While baby bok choy is prettier, if you have regular bok choy, just chop it (stems and leaves) into 2 inch segments for easier eating, or just cook the stalks whole, broken off the main stem.]Combine soy sauce, oyster sauce, sugar and rice vinegar in a bowl and set aside. [I tasted the sauce on its own, and found the taste quite strong, but when added to the vegetable, it mellows out– don’t worry!]Heat oil in a skillet or wok set over high heat. When it shimmers, add garlic, then bok choy, and stir-fry for 2 minutes. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons water to the skillet or wok, then cover it and allow to cook for 2 to 3 minutes more, until bok choy has softened nicely at its base. [I didn’t want to have my sauce too diluted, since not all the water cooks away, so I used about 1 tbsp water and 1 tbsp of the sauce in this step Since I served my bok choy over rice, I find more sauce, or less diluted sauce, adds flavor to the rice.]Remove bok choy from the skillet or wok and place it on a warmed platter. Drizzle the reserved sauce over the greens and serve.

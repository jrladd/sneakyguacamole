<p>Looking for something original to bring to a holiday party? I was in that position earlier this week for my work place&rsquo;s holiday party. However, when I saw this recipe, I knew I was set. Arancini (aka risotto balls) are perfect finger food and incredibly unique. While a little time intensive, it&rsquo;s not a hard recipe, either. Plus: you can start it the day before, and it can be served room temperature. YAY! Brought to you by <a href="http://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/arancini-with-peas-and-mozzarella">Food and Wine</a> and holiday parties. [PS&ndash; this is the first time I fried anything, so there&rsquo;s a first time for everything. Be a brave cook! I only burned myself once&ndash;small blister on my thumb. :P ]</p>

<ul><li>5 cups chicken stock or canned low-sodium broth</li>
<li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
<li>&frac14; cup minced shallots</li>
<li>1 &frac12; cups arborio rice (10 &frac12; ounces)</li>
<li>&frac12; cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese (2 ounces)</li>
<li>Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper</li>
<li>2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley</li>
<li>4 large eggs</li>
<li>&frac12; cup all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1 cup fine dry bread crumbs</li>
<li>1 &frac12; ounces mozzarella, cut into eighteen &frac12;-inch dice</li>
<li>18 fresh or frozen peas</li>
<li>Vegetable oil, for frying</li>
</ul><ol><li>Bring the chicken stock to a simmer in a medium saucepan; keep warm.</li>
<li>Melt the butter in a medium saucepan. Add the shallots and cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 3 minutes. Add the rice and cook, stirring, for 4 minutes. <i>I think risotto doesn&rsquo;t count unless it has wine in it. So at this point, add about a &frac12; cup of white wine and cook until wine is absorbed.</i></li>
<li>Add 1 cup of the stock to the pan and cook, stirring gently, until all the stock is absorbed. Add the remaining stock, &frac12; cup at a time, and cook, stirring gently, until the rice is al dente, about 25 minutes. Stir in the Parmesan, 2 teaspoons of salt and &frac14; teaspoon of pepper.</li>
<li>Transfer the risotto to a heatproof bowl and let cool for 10 minutes. Stir in the parsley and 1 egg. Press a piece of plastic wrap directly onto the rice and refrigerate the risotto for at least 4 hours or, preferably, overnight. <i>Make this easy for yourself and do it the day before!</i></li>
<li>Line a baking sheet with wax paper. In a shallow bowl, beat the remaining 3 eggs. Put the flour and bread crumbs on separate plates. Season the bread crumbs with salt. Using moistened hands, form &frac14;-cup portions of the rice into 2-inch balls. Tuck a piece of mozzarella and a pea in the center of each rice ball and seal any holes. Set the balls on the baking sheet.<img src="http://66.media.tumblr.com/3c8d34647f0cb4a2a53d2a94012d59a7/tumblr_inline_mxis8qdJTR1son4ik.jpg" alt="image"/></li>
<li>Dredge the rice balls in the flour, tapping off any excess. Working with 1 at a time, dip each ball in the egg, then coat with bread crumbs, rolling and pressing it into a compact ball.<img src="http://66.media.tumblr.com/2d1e1990f136c3836881b0d4cedb08b7/tumblr_inline_mxis99UwR11son4ik.jpg" alt="image"/></li>
<li>Heat &frac12; inch of vegetable oil in a large cast-iron skillet. When the oil is very hot, add all of the rice balls and cook over moderate heat, turning, until golden and crisp all over, about 8 minutes. Drain the balls on paper towels, then transfer to a large platter. Sprinkle the <i>arancini</i> lightly with salt and serve.<img src="http://67.media.tumblr.com/a3a5691ce629f9cd4b41d4461a4c45bd/tumblr_inline_mxis9xejYm1son4ik.jpg" alt="image"/></li>

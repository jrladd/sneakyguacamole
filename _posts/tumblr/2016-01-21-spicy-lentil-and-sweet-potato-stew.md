Super tasty and makes quite a lot of food! I wouldn’t freeze this because of the amount of potato, so plan ahead for a lot of leftovers (we had three meals for two people) or feel free to halve the recipe. Via NYT. 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil1 medium onion, chopped2 garlic cloves, minced Salt to taste2 teaspoons cumin seeds, lightly toasted and ground [I substituted 1 tsp ground cumin.]2 medium carrots, diced1 ½ cups brown or green lentils, rinsed6 cups water2 medium-size sweet potatoes (aka yams, with dark orange flesh, 1 to 1 ¼ pounds), peeled and cut in large dice1 to 2 chipotles in adobo, seeded and chopped (to taste) [Two was more my taste. This is where you’re getting a lot of the flavor.]2 tablespoons tomato paste1 bay leaf¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro or parsley (to taste) Lime wedges for servingHeat the olive oil over medium heat in a large, heavy soup pot or Dutch oven.Add the onion. Cook, stirring often, until it softens, about 5 minutes.Add the garlic and a generous pinch of salt. Cook, stirring, until the garlic smells fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the ground cumin seeds and carrots. Stir together for a minute.Add the lentils, water, sweet potatoes, chipotles, tomato paste, salt to taste and the bay leaf. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, cover and simmer 40 to 45 minutes, until the lentils and sweet potatoes are tender and the broth fragrant. Taste and adjust seasoning. Stir in the cilantro or parsley, simmer for another minute, and serve, passing lime wedges so diners can season their lentils with a squeeze of lime juice if desired.Advance preparation: This will be good for 3 or 4 four days but it will thicken as the lentils will continue to swell. If you want to thin it out, add water or stock.

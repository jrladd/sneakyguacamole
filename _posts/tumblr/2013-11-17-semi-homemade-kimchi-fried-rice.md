Sometimes, you just don’t have the time or energy to cook. That’s cool, yo. In my case, I’ll start with a base and then add homemade touches (like a protein or a fried egg). For example, when I made Kimchi Fried Rice, the main base is Kimchi I bought at Trader Joe’s. All you do is cook rice, which really just does it’s own thing, and chicken (though if you’re feeling lazy, don’t even worry about cooking meat). This recipe took me about 30 minutes total, filled John and I up, and left us with leftovers.
This recipe brought to you by Trader Joe’s, my Sunday laziness, and Food 52.

Kimchi Fried Rice


1 to 2 tablespoons canola or vegetable oil
1/2 pound chicken or pork (cut into bite-size), or shrimp, optional (I did one chicken breast)
4 to 5 scallions, whites only, finely sliced (Had no scallions so I skipped this)
1 to 1 1/2 cup kimchi, chopped
1 to 2 tablespoons gochujang (Korean chili paste) (I had and used thai chili paste I received in a Thai food gift basket from my sister, but you can use Sriracha or any other chili paste you like)
1-2 cups cooked rice
1 teaspoon sesame oil
2 teaspoons soy sauce
1 pinch salt, to taste
Heat canola or vegetable oil in a large, deep frying pan over high heat. Then add chicken, pork, or raw shrimp (if using) and cook, stirring frequently, for several minutes until the meat changes color and begins to look nearly cooked. Add more oil if necessary.
Add the scallion whites, and cook while stirring for 1 to 2 minutes. Next add kimchi and kochujang, and cook while stirring for 3 to 5 minutes until the kimchi starts to get soft. (If using pre-cooked shrimp, add now, and stir to coat with kimchi flavors.)
Add the rice, sesame oil, and soy sauce. Then mix well until the rice is coated with the kimchi. 
Continue cooking, stirring constantly, for just a few more minutes until the rice is warmed through. Season with salt, to taste.
Serve topped with a fried egg.
Note: If your kimchi is really pungent, just add a little more soy sauce to the finished fried rice to balance out the taste.


YUM.

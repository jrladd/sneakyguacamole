I really loved this, but this is one of those recipes that I think just wouldn’t work as well without fresh pasta. The sauce is so subtle that the texture of fresh pasta is half the pleasure, so give fresh pasta making a try! Via Food 52. (While the original recipe has a fresh pasta recipe, I highly recommend a more simple version: Marcella Hazan’s pasta recipe.)4 tablespoons olive oil½ medium yellow onion, very finely diced4 cups (about 8 ounces) assorted mushrooms (such as maitake, morels and king trumpets), cut or torn into thin slices¼ cup chicken stock3 tablespoons unsalted butter¼ cup finely grated Parmesan cheese, plus more to top2 tablespoons finely chopped flat-leaf parsley, divided2 teaspoons finely chopped rosemary, dividedBring a large pot of salted water to a boil.In a large skillet over medium heat, warm the oil. Add the onions. Season with salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft and translucent, 4 to 6 minutes. Add the mushrooms and cook until lightly browned and softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Season with salt and continue to cook for another 2 to 3 minutes. If the pan looks dry, add another tablespoon of olive oil.Meanwhile, add the pasta to the boiling salted water and cook it two thirds of the way through, 10 to 20 seconds. The pasta will finish cooking in the sauce.Drain the pasta, reserving ½ cup of the pasta cooking liquid.Add the pasta, chicken stock, butter, ¼ cup Parmesan and half the parsley and rosemary to the mushroom ragout and cook, thinning with the reserved pasta cooking liquid as needed, until the pasta is coated with sauce and cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes. Top with the remaining herbs and a sprinkle of Parmesan.

I really don’t eat breakfast all that much. I rather sleep until the last minute I can, quickly dress, run out the door with coffee, and have an early lunch. But when I do have breakfast, I want it to be HOT. Therefore, I’m always looking for great, warm breakfast ideas. This one, from Vegetarian Times magazine, is one of my FAVS. 

1 cup green lentils
½ onion, left whole
2 cloves garlic, smashed
1 bay leaf
1 tsp. butter, optional (I think it’s a must  . . )
1 squeeze lemon juice
2 eggs
1 Tbs. chopped chives or green onion (optional)
1 Tbs. chopped red bell pepper (optional)
Bring lentils and 2 ½ cups water to a boil with onion, garlic, and bay leaf. Cover, and simmer 25 minutes, or until liquid is absorbed.
Remove and discard onion, garlic, and bay leaf; stir in 1 tsp. butter (if using); and season with salt and pepper. (I usually just leave the onion and garlic in–I chop up my onion in this case– and discard the bay leaf.)
Spoon lentils into 2 bowls, add a squeeze of fresh lemon juice, and top each serving with 1 poached egg. Garnish with chives or chopped green onion and chopped red bell pepper.

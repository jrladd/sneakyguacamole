<ul><li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
<li>1 tablespoon good olive oil</li>
<li>2 cups chopped yellow onions (2 onions)</li>
<li>1 (15 - ounce) can pumpkin puree (not pumpkin pie filling)</li>
<li>1 &frac12; pounds butternut squash, peeled and cut in chunks</li>
<li>3 cups homemade chicken stock or canned broth</li>
<li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
<li>&frac12; teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
<li>1 cup half - and - half</li>
<li>Creme fraiche, grated Gruyere, or croutons (see Note), for serving (optional)</li>
</ul><p>Heat the butter and oil in a heavy - bottomed stockpot, add the onions, and cook over medium - low heat for 10 minutes, or until translucent. Add the pumpkin puree, butternut squash, chicken stock, salt, and pepper.</p><img src="http://65.media.tumblr.com/647072d7b2b561c0768de9c0df4eac9a/tumblr_inline_nhu9n3tyn21son4ik.jpg" alt="image"/>Cover and simmer over medium - low heat for about 20 minutes, until the butternut squash is very tender. Process the mixture through the medium blade of a food mill. (<i>I use a immersion blender.</i>)<img src="http://67.media.tumblr.com/1ac40f0fb0a5f892842caf23b25cc8cf/tumblr_inline_nhu9olZ9gB1son4ik.jpg" alt="image"/>Return to the pot, add the half - and - half, and heat slowly. If the soup needs more flavor, add another teaspoon of salt. Serve hot with garnishes, if desired.<img src="http://66.media.tumblr.com/5a1c7d5e190f525792c611fbed931490/tumblr_inline_nhu9p16J8y1son4ik.jpg" alt="image"/>Cook&rsquo;s Note: To serve with croutons, remove the crusts from 2 slices of white bread, cut them in &frac12;-inch cubes, and saute them in 1 tablespoon of butter until browned. Season with salt and pepper.
<p><b>COOKING HINT:</b></p>
<p>Most people think butternut squash is unwieldy and aren&rsquo;t worth the effort. However, these two things should help:</p>
<ol><li>Having trouble peeling and chopping the squash? Treat it like a potato! Pierce the squash several times with a tined fork and heat in the microwave for a couple minutes. Then you can peel the squash with a peeler and it should be must easier to chop.</li>
<li>Best way to get the seeds out? Cut the very end of the squash off, then scoop out the seeds from the butt of the squash, rather than trying to cut it in half then scoop out.<img src="http://65.media.tumblr.com/90e62e0e5be144ad194daba9a09ffa18/tumblr_inline_nhu9uyz4q81son4ik.jpg" alt="image"/></li>

Always willing to try a new beef stew recipe. I prefer Pepin’s Red Wine Beef Stew (which I’ve posted on this blog), but John prefers a more gravy based traditional beef stew. I think I preferred the other one (on the blog as Old Fashioned Beef Stew) more, but this recipe was still solid (and very easy). 


2 pounds stew beef
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 cups water
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 clove garlic, peeled
1 or 2 bay leaves
1 medium onion, sliced
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon sugar
½ teaspoon pepper
½ teaspoon paprika
Dash ground allspice or ground cloves
3 large carrots, sliced
3 ribs celery, chopped
turnips (my addition, makes it more hardy, 1 large one or a couple medium ones diced, about an equal amount to the carrots and celery)
2 tablespoons cornstarch
Brown meat in hot oil. (Remember it will stew for hours, so you only need to brown it, not ensure it’s fully cooked through.)


Add water, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, bay leaves, onion, salt, sugar, pepper, paprika, and allspice. Cover and simmer 1 ½ hours. 
Remove bay leaves and garlic clove. Add carrots and celery. Cover and cook 30 to 40 minutes longer. 
To thicken gravy, remove 2 cups hot liquid. Using a separate bowl, combine ¼ cup water and cornstarch until smooth. Mix with a little hot liquid and return mixture to pot. Stir and cook until bubbly.

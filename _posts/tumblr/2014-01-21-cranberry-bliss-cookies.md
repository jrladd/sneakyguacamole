HOLIDAY GIFT PALOOZA PART 2: fruity cookies.
While I was fairly positive I took pictures of all my cookie creations, I can’t find any but my caramels, so excuse the less colorful nature of these next few posts. Note: my cookies ended up looking like the recipe’s pictures, YAY! Also, more than one person told me this was their favorite cookie, so it’s a crowd pleaser.
Thanks Cookies & Cups!
Cookies ingredients
¾ cup butter, room temperature
2 oz cream cheese, room temperature
1 ¼ cup light brown sugar
2 eggs
2 tsp vanilla
1 tsp baking soda
½ tsp salt
2 ¼ cups flour
1 cup white chocolate chips
¾ cup coarsely chopped dried cranberries
Frosting ingredients
6 oz cream cheese, room temperature
¼ cup butter, room temperature
1 ½ cups powdered sugar
½ cup white chocolate chips, melted
Topping ingredients
½ cup coarsely chopped dried cranberries
½ cup white chocolate chips, melted (I probably would have left off the drizzle of white chocolate, just because I don’t have a double boiler so it was difficult, and I think the cookies work fine without it.
Cookie recipe:
In bowl of stand mixer, cream butter and cream cheese together until smooth.
Beat in brown sugar for 1-2 minutes until fluffy.
Add in eggs, vanilla, baking soda and salt and beat until evenly mixed. Turn mixer to low and add in flour.
Stir in white chocolate chips and chopped cranberries. Chill dough for 2 hours or overnight. 
Preheat oven to 375°. Line baking sheets with parchment paper.
Drop dough on baking sheet about 2 inches apart and bake for 9-11 minutes, until edges are golden and centers are just set.
Transfer to wire rack to cool.
Frosting recipe:
Beat cream cheese and butter together until smooth. Mix in powdered sugar and beat until creamy. Finally mix in melted white chocolate, beating until incorporated.
Spread frosting on top of cookies.
Topping recipe:
To garnish, sprinkle remaining chopped dried cranberries on top of cookies, evenly distributing them among all the cookies. Finally, drizzle melted chocolate on top.

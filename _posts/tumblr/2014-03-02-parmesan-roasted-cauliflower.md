AMAZING side dish.



1 head cauliflower
1 sliced medium onion
4 thyme sprigs
4 unpeeled garlic cloves
3 tablespoons olive oil
Kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper
½ cup grated Parmesan
Preheat over to 425 degrees F. Cut one head cauliflower into florets; toss on a large rimmed baking sheet with 1 sliced medium onion, 4 thyme sprigs, 4 unpeeled garlic cloves, and 3 tablespoons olive oil; season with kosher salt and ground black pepper. Roast, tossing occasionally, until almost tender, 35-40 minutes. Sprinkle with ½ cup grated Parmesan, toss to combine, and roast until cauliflower is tender, 10-12 minutes longer. (It was already tender when I added the Parmesan, so I only cooked a few minutes more.)

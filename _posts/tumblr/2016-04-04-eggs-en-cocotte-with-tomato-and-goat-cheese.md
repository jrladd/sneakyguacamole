A delicious homemade brunch! Via Serious Eats. 2 tablespoons (30ml) extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing ramekins and drizzling½ medium onion (5 ounces; 150g), thinly sliced (about 1 cup)1 medium clove garlic, roughly chopped1 (28-ounce) can peeled whole tomatoes (1 pound 12 ounces; 800g), drained and crushed by hand1 rosemary sprigKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper4 large eggs1 ounce (30g) goat cheese, crumbledBoiling waterToasted bread, for servingPreheat oven to 350°F (175°C). In a medium saucepan, heat olive oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onion and garlic and cook, stirring, until softened, about 4 minutes. Add crushed tomatoes and rosemary and cook, stirring, until thickened, about 4 minutes longer. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat. Discard rosemary sprig.Grease 4 (4-ounce) ramekins with olive oil. Lightly sprinkle salt on the bottom and side of each ramekin. Scoop enough tomato mixture to form a thin, even layer on the bottom of each ramekin. Form a circular depression in the center of the tomato mixture in each ramekin. (This will help cradle the egg yolk and keep it centered.) [Note: You will have a lot of tomato sauce left, so consider how you may use it in another recipe that week!]Gently slide an egg into each ramekin. Arrange crumbled goat cheese around each egg, then season with salt and pepper. Place ramekins in a baking dish and transfer to oven. Carefully pour enough boiling water into baking dish to submerge ramekins ¾ of the way. Bake eggs en cocotte until whites are just set and yolks are still jiggly, about 15 minutes. Very carefully remove baking dish from oven. [For me, it was more like 20-25 minutes. I ended up over cooking my yolks a bit to get the complete cook through of the whites, so I may shoot for 20 minutes next time, but it’s guesswork. You kind of just have to jiggle the ramekins to get a sense of the doneness of the whites, and of course, there’s personal preference for egg doneness.]Using a very thin metal spatula and tongs, lift each ramekin out of the hot water. Set ramekins on a clean kitchen towel to dry bottoms, then transfer to plates. Drizzle with fresh olive oil and serve right away with toasts.

I’ve never poached eggs before, and after reading multiple articles on how to best poach an egg, I combined multiple tips and methods: I added a little salt and about 2 tbsp of white vinegar to my water. I put the eggs in small mesh strainers to get rid of the runny part of the white, so it wouldn’t spider web out, and slowly lowered them in. Was the poaching perfect? Nope, but it was a good first attempt. I think I’ll try America’s Test Kitchen’s approach next time, maybe on this Kitchn recipe again because it was SO tasty!

Sea salt
½ pound haricots verts or slender green beans, trimmed
pesto
eggs

Have ready a large bowl of ice water. Bring a large saucepan three-fourths full of generously salted water to a boil over high heat. Drop in the beans all at once and cook for 3 minutes. Drain and immediately plunge the beans into ice water. Set aside.


If you want to make their recommended almond pesto (see the recipe above for the exact amount of ingredients): In a food processor or blender, combine the garlic, parsley, and ½ teaspoon salt and process until the parsley is finely chopped. With the machine running, add the olive oil in a slow steady stream and process until a smooth purée forms. Add the almonds and pulse until finely chopped and the pesto is a uniform coarse purée. [I just used pesto I already had fresh made–kale arugula pesto].


Drain the beans and pat dry. Put them in a large bowl, add the pesto, and toss to coat evenly. Arrange the beans on a serving platter or in a bowl and serve at room temperature. Serve with a poached egg, if desired.

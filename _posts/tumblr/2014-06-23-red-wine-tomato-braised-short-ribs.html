<p>Part of my on-going attempts to learn how to cook meat. This recipe is from Carla&rsquo;s Comfort Foods!</p>

<p><b>Gremolata</b></p>
<ul><li>&frac14; cup finely chopped flat leaf parsley leaves</li>
<li>1 tsp minced fresh thyme leaves</li>
<li>&frac12; minced fresh rosemary leaves</li>
<li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
<li>&frac14; tsp kosher salt</li>
</ul><p><b>Short Ribs</b></p>
<ul><li>2 tsp minced fresh rosemary leaves</li>
<li>2 tsp chopped fresh thyme leaves</li>
<li>kosher salt and black pepper</li>
<li>8 3-inch pieces bone-in short ribs (2 &frac34; lbs total)</li>
<li>1 large yellow onion, finely chopped</li>
<li>4 garlic cloves, peeled</li>
<li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
<li>&frac12; cup dry red wine</li>
<li>2 cups unsalted beef stock</li>
</ul><ol><li>To make gremolata: In a bowl, rub the ingredients together with your fingertips.</li>
<li>To make the short ribs: Rub the rosemary, thyme, 1 &frac12; tsp salt, and &frac12; tsp black pepper all over the ribs. Let sit for one hour.</li>
<li>Heat a large, wide Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the short ribs, fat side down, in a single layer, spacing the ribs apart. Don&rsquo;t crowd the pan; work in batches if you have to. Cook, turning once, until browned, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a plate.</li>
<li>Drain the fat from the pan, leaving a thin film behind, and add the onion and garlic. Reduce the heat to low. Cook, stirring and scraping the browned bits from the bottom of the pan, until the onions are lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. </li>

<ol><li>Add the wine, raise the heat to high, and cook until almost completely evaporated. Add the stock, bring to a boil, and then adjust the heat to maintain a steady simmer. Nestle the ribs in the vegetables in a single layer, bone side down. Partially cover and simmer until fork tender, about 3 hours. Top with the gremolata and serve. </li>

So here we have steel coat oats oatmeal and apples cooked in butter and brown sugar. He says it&rsquo;s based on LV Anderson&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2012/10/10/steel_cut_oats_are_overrated_rolled_oats_cooked_with_milk_and_served_with_saut_ed_apples_are_the_way_to_go_.html">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Doing It Wrong&rdquo; Slate column</a>. She insists rolled oats are better because they&rsquo;re creamy, but what she calls creamy, John calls mushy. So he makes almost the same recipe but with steel cut oats. Note: I wouldn&rsquo;t know; I <em>hate</em> oatmeal.</p>

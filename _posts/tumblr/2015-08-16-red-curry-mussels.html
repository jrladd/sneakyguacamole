<p>Despite having grown up near a coast and eaten seafood all my life, I find the idea of cooking seafood at home, especially now that I live in a land-locked stated, terrifying. Nonetheless, I’m happy to say that mussels were incredibly easy and relatively cheap (1 LB= 8ish dollars). Most places will clean and debeard them for you, but always make sure to ask if they do, since that step can be a lot trickier.

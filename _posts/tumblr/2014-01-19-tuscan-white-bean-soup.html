<ul><li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving</li>
<li>1 medium onion, finely diced (about 1 cup)</li>
<li>2 medium carrots, finely diced (about 1 cup)</li>
<li>2 ribs celery, finely diced (about 1 cup)</li>
<li>4 cloves garlic, minced </li>
<li>&frac12; teaspoon dried red pepper flakes</li>
<li>1 quart homemade or low-sodium canned chicken broth</li>
<li>2 (15-ounce) cans white beans (cannellini or great northern)</li>
<li>4 6-inch sprigs rosemary, leaves finely chopped and stems reserved</li>
<li>1 (3-4 inch) chunk parmesan rind (optional) <i>[I was able to buy parmesan rinds for cheap at my Whole Foods. Just store them in your freezer.]</i></li>
<li>2 bay leaves</li>
<li>3 to 4 cups roughly chopped kale or swiss chard leaves</li>
<li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
<li>Parmigiano-Reggiano for serving</li>
</ul><p><i>* Also, I always add chorizo to this recipe, and I find it really adds something extra. So what I do is take 1-2 links of chorizo (&frac14; to &frac12; lb or more if you want), take it out of its casing (if it&rsquo;s cased, you can also get bulk, ground chorizo), and brown it. When finished, pat it down and set it to the side. Then add it to the soup after you&rsquo;ve pulsed the soup a few times with your immersion blender.</i></p>
<p>1. Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onions, carrots, and celery and cook, stirring frequently, until softened but not browned, about 3 minutes. Add garlic and dried red pepper flakes and cook, stirring constantly until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add chicken broth, beans and their liquid, rosemary stems, parmesan rind, and bay leaves. Increase heat to high, and bring to a boil. Reduce to a bare simmer, add kale, cover and cook for 15 minutes.</p>
<p>2. Discard the bay leaves and rosemary stems. Use a hand blender to roughly puree part of the beans until desired consistency is reached. Alternatively, transfer 2 cups of soup to a blender or food processor and process until smooth (start on low speed and increase to high to prevent blender blow-out). Return to the soup and stir to combine. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</p>
<p>3. Ladle into bowls, sprinkle with reserved chopped rosemary leaves, drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil and a grating of Parmigiano-Reggiano, and serve with crusty toasted bread.</p>

A quick tasty meal from Curtis Stone’s What’s for Dinner?.


1 lb kale, well washed, tough stems removed, leaves thinly sliced
1 lb pasta
¾ cup olive oil
6 garlic cloves, finely chopped
2 tbsp grated lemon zest (from about 4 lemons) [I don’t know about you, but I don’t really have that many lemons to spare! Instead I added the zest one 1 lemon, then added juice from the lemon as need–more I think than the recipe added for. Still got that great, fresh lemony taste. Just taste as you go to determine how much of the lemon’s juice you want.]
kosher salt and black pepper
2 tbsp fresh lemon juice
3 oz grated parmesan cheese [between ¾ cup and 1 cup, but once again, just use your judgement!]
Bring a large pot of salted water to boil over high heat. Add the kale and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until tender. Using a mesh spoon or sieve, scoop the kale out of the water, draining it well, and transfer it to a bowl [not as easy as it sounds, haha].
Return the water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook, stirring often to ensure it doesn’t stick, until al dente. I always just follow the instructions on the pasta package.Scoop out and reserve ½ cup of the pasta cooking water then drain the pasta. 
Heat a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Add ½ cup olive oil and the garlic and cook for about 30 seconds or until fragrant. Stir in the kale, add the lemon zest, and season with salt and pepper. Add the pasta and the remaining ¼ cup olive oil, and toss to coat. Stir in the lemon juice, followed by half of the cheese. Season to taste, stir in the reserved pasta water to moisten the pasta as necessary. Serve with remaining cheese.

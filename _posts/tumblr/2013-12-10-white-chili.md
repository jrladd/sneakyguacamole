John refuses to admit this is chili. He concedes that it’s super tasty but that it certainly isn’t chili. I’m a Southerner. I believe in white chili. PLUS we get ground turkey semi often in our CSA. I don’t know about you, but for me, ground turkey is BORING. This is a fantastical way to use it.
Brought to you by an urge to prove John wrong, football, and Food Network.
Not the cutest picture, I acknowledge. But take my word for it– NOM.
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 medium onion, diced (about 1 ½ cups)
2 stalks celery, diced (about ½ cup)
3 medium poblano peppers (about 4 ounces each), seeded and white ribs removed, finely diced (about 1 ½ cups) (I had frozen green chilies)
1 clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon ground cumin
½ teaspoon ground coriander
¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper, more to taste
1 pound ground white meat turkey
2 (15.5-ounce) cans white beans such as cannelini, preferably low-sodium, drained and rinsed (We used dried beans that we had pre-quick soaked, because that’s all we had!)
4 cups low-sodium chicken broth
¾ teaspoon dried oregano
1 (15.5-ounce) can hominy, drained and rinsed (I love hominy but I didn’t have any, so I used barley, which was an amazing substitute)
Salt
¼ cup nonfat plain Greek-style yogurt (optional, I didn’t add any)
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro leaves (optional, I didn’t add any)
Lime wedges (lime juice actually made a HUGE difference to this dish, so if you have lime, squeeze those bitches over this chili)
Heat the oil in large pot or Dutch oven over moderate heat. Add the onion, celery, poblanos, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are soft, about 8 minutes. Add the garlic, cumin, coriander and cayenne and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
Add the ground turkey and cook, breaking up the meat with a spoon, until the meat is no longer pink about 2 minutes (it took me longer, more like 5-10 mins). Add the white beans, broth and oregano. Cook, partially covered, stirring occasionally, for 25 minutes.
Add the hominy and salt and more cayenne pepper, to taste, and continue cooking, partially covered, 10 minutes longer. Ladle into individual bowls and top each serving with 1 tablespoon of yogurt and 1 ½ teaspoons of cilantro. Garnish with a lime wedge. (John and I like a creamier chili, so we just immersion blendered the chili up a little. But whatever you like consistency-wise!)
YUM!

While ideally I would like to buy tahini at some point, I appreciate that this hummus recipe consists of mainly things I always have in our home. Thanks Alton!


2 to 3 cloves garlic
1 can garbanzo beans (chickpeas), drained and liquid reserved
2 to 3 tablespoons smooth peanut butter
A handful fresh parsley leaves
1 lemon, zested and juiced
Pinch freshly ground black pepper
Pinch kosher salt
1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil
Chop the garlic finely in a food processor. 
Add the beans and Â½ of the reserved liquid and process finely or to desired consistency. 
Add the peanut butter, parsley, lemon zest and juice, black pepper, and salt. 
Process until it forms a paste. 
Drizzle in the olive oil and process until it reaches the consistency of mayonnaise. [I like to sprinkle paprika on top!]

Tofu freaks people out. It’s got a strange texture so you’ve got to test it out til you find the texture you like. Personally, silken tofu isn’t my favorite. BUT I do dearly love the hearty, almost meat like texture tofu takes on when you freeze it. Freeze it?! you say? Yes. Go to your local TJs or favorite grocery store, pick up a package of extra firm tofu. Drain it (I place my tofu block between two paper towels on a plate and press it with cans.) After letting it drain for a ½ hr or so, slice it into ½-1 inch slices and freeze in a freezer safe ziplock. When you’re ready to cook it, just throw it into the fridge to defrost. 
This is my favorite way to prepare tofu. Tofu is best with a marinade, since it doesn’t really have a strong flavor. You can marinate it for a while, but I just sort of dip the tofu in it then dry fry it on a pan (no need for oil, etc).

1 16-oz. pkg. extra-firm tofu, drained and cut into slices (or bite sized cubes)
2 cloves garlic, minced (2 tsp.), divided
3 ½ Tbs. low-sodium soy sauce
2 Tbs. hoisin sauce
1 tsp. toasted sesame oil, divided
1 ½ tsp. dark brown sugar
¼ tsp. freshly ground black pepper

 Place tofu in bowl with 2 tsp. garlic.


 Whisk together soy sauce, hoisin sauce, 1 tsp. sesame oil, brown sugar, pepper, and 1 Tbs. water in small bowl. Pour over tofu; toss gently to coat. Set aside to marinate.


Pan fry tofu until browned/seared on each side.

Serve with WHATEVER you want! In this picture, I have it with rice and hoisin brussels sprouts.

Tonight at dinner I ordered green beans as my side. What I got was obviously canned beans. I hate to be a food snob but… Ew. This is my veggie hierarchy:  Fresh (and preferably in season) first. Then frozen, because fresh, in season veggies are blanched then frozen so it keeps well. Canned? No thanks, unless it’s tomatoes or something home canned/pickled.

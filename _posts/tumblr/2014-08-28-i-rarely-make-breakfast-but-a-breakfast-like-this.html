Fresh strawberries, scrambled eggs with ricotta, and local (Windy Lake) sage breakfast sausage! Also: I&rsquo;ve discovered the secret to good scrambled eggs&ndash;half and half! Use 4 eggs (and add another yolk for more creaminess) and 2 tbsp &frac12; and &frac12;, and season with salt and pepper. Before putting the in pan, melt &frac12; tbsp of butter. It makes all the difference&ndash;no more dried out eggs. Fancy.</p>

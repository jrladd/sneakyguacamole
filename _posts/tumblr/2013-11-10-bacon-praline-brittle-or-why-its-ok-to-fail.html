<p>When I tell people how much I love to cook, I often get the response that the person I&rsquo;m talking to doesn&rsquo;t cook because he/she isn&rsquo;t good at it or is scared of it. I&rsquo;m like, WHA? Don&rsquo;t be scared! I mess up ALL THE TIME. It&rsquo;s no big deal. It&rsquo;s a skill you learn; you just keep going! This bacon praline brittle is a great example.</p>
<p>I have not been very successful making candy. When I tried my first candy adventure last year (Smitten Kitchen&rsquo;s apple cider caramels), the end result was a very delicious, but a very unset, drippy caramel sauce. Wonderful on ice cream. Failure as a caramel candy. So, I got a wild hair up my butt last week and decided to make bacon candy. Because &hellip;bacon. To make this candy, you have to marinate the bacon in sweet happiness for a whole day before you can bake it and continue with the recipe.</p>
<p>After doin the marinating thing, I put those puppies in the oven. Disclaimer: I did a bad thing. The recipe called for thick cut bacon but I just used the regular cut bacon I had. Not necessarily bad, but I see now it led to my eventual problem; cookin makes you think, man. The recipe called for the bacon to bake for 20-30 minutes. I knew my bacon was thinner, so I set the timer for 20 mins&ndash; on the lower side. I checked it after 10 minutes and it looked beautiful. I went sit on the couch and to hang out with John. Then, I noticed the room looked &hellip; misty? I was like, &ldquo;John, does it look foggy to you?&rdquo; I went to check on the bacon and when I opened the oven, WOOSH. All the smoke and burnt bacon smell and everything came out. Fire detectors wailing, I brought the smouldering bacon out onto our porch to cool off. Though it was 11 PM, we opened all our doors/windows to air out our apartment. It took an hour before my eyes stopped watering with all the smoke. It was a mess.</p>
<p>But you know what? F that. Try and try again, mf. So, the next week, I bought (the correct cut) bacon, marinated, then cooked. And it was totes worth it.</p>

<p><b>Bacon Praline Brittle</b>*</p>
<p>*<i>note, while this is called a brittle, the consistency is MUCH closer to a praline</i></p>
<p><b>Candied Bacon</b><br/>&frac12; lb. thick sliced bacon (W<i>hen reading recipes, I always wonder&ndash; does this type of ingredient REALLY matter? In this case, thick cut does</i>.)<br/>&frac12; cup dark brown sugar<br/>&frac14; cup pure maple syrup<br/>2 tbsp. molasses (I<i> used what I had&ndash; sorghum</i>)<br/>&frac12; tsp. black pepper</p>
<p><b>Praline<br/></b>&frac34; cup granulated sugar<br/>2 tbsp. water<br/>&frac12; cup chopped pecans<br/>&frac12; tsp. kosher salt<br/>1 tbsp. butter, at room temperature<br/>1 &frac14; cup chopped candied bacon (from above)<br/>1 tsp. flaked sea salt</p>
<p><b>Instructions:</b></p>
<p><b>Candied Bacon</b></p>
<p>1. In a large zip-top bag combine bacon, dark brown sugar, molasses maple syrup and pepper. Coat the bacon with all the ingredients by squeezing the bag, working all the ingredients together.</p>
<p>2. Chill for 24 hours.</p>
<p>3. On a foil lined baking sheet lay bacon flat and bake at 375° for 25-30 minutes, until bacon is brown and crisp.</p>
<p>4. Transfer pan to a wire rack and allow to cool.</p>
<p>5. Once cooled chop bacon.</p>
<p>6. Line another baking sheet with a nonstick line and set aside.</p>

<p><i>Before cooking. When it comes out, it will look sort of burnt/dark dark brown. </i></p>

<p><b>Praline</b></p>
<p>7. For praline combine granulated sugar and 2 Tbsp water. Cook over medium heat for 3-4 minutes until sugar is dissolved. Add in chopped pecans and kosher salt. Stir continuously for 4-5 minutes (Mixture will be boiling) until it becomes a deep amber color. Stirring prevents the pecans from burning.</p>
<p>8. Remove from heat and immediately stir in butter and chopped bacon.</p>
<p><i>In my case, I hit a snag here. The mixture started to dry and clump. Once again, don&rsquo;t be scared! I just added a little water and stirred it. Failure averted!</i></p>
<p>9. Once bacon it coated completely with caramel mixture spread evenly onto your lined pan and sprinkle with flaked sea salt.</p>
<p>10. Allow to cool and break into pieces.</p>

<p><b>YUM.</b></p>

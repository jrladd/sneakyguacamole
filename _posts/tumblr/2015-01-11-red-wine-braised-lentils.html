<p>Lentils are my favorite breakfast, and if I can work wine into it, more the better. :) Via <a href="http://food52.com/recipes/31876-judy-rodgers-lentils-braised-in-red-wine">Food52</a>.</p>

<ul><li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
<li>1/2 cup carrots, diced</li>
<li>1/2 cup celery, diced</li>
<li>3/4 cup onions, diced</li>
<li>1 bay leaf</li>
<li>1 1/4 cups lentils (ideally the du puy type) </li>
<li>1 or 2 sprigs fresh thyme (optional)</li>
<li>1 cup red wine</li>
<li>2 to 2 1/2 cups water, chicken stock, or a combination</li>
<li>2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
</ul><ol><li>In a medium-sized pan, warm the olive oil over medium-low heat and add the carrots, celery, and onions, along with a few pinches of salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about five minutes.</li>
<li>Raise the heat slightly and add the lentils, bay leaf, thyme (if using), the wine, and a cup of the water or stock. When the lentils begin to simmer, lower the heat and cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, and adding small amounts of additional water or stock as each is absorbed.<img src="http://65.media.tumblr.com/18243977b7195fa0d063b8773437ce01/tumblr_inline_nhuanxJSVx1son4ik.jpg" alt="image"/></li>
<li>After about a half-hour, the finished lentils should be nutty but tender and just slightly wet. (You may have water or stock left over.) Salt to taste. Drizzle with the final tablespoons of olive oil and cook for another minute, then serve.</li>
</ol><p><b>NOTE:</b></p>
<p>I put a soft boiled egg on top. How do you soft boil an egg? Here&rsquo;s the method I learned from Cook&rsquo;s Illustrated:</p>
<ul><li>Put 1-2 inches of water in a pot and boil. </li>
<li>Once the water is boiling, slowly lower your eggs into the water then cover the pot&ndash;keep the water boiling. </li>
<li>After 5-6 minutes, take the pot off the heat, runs the eggs under cold water for 30 seconds or so, then carefully peel.</li>
</ul><p>Your white should be hard, but your yolk should be runny. You&rsquo;ll get the hang of just how long it should cook after a few times. Lately, I&rsquo;m shooting for 5 &frac12; minutes.</p>

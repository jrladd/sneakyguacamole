Trying to make the most of the season’s harvest and this recipe from The Forest Feast bubbled to the top! Besides using fresh kale from a friend’s garden in the pasta, we made kale & arugula pesto from the goods of that same garden!

a few kale stalks 3-5, the kale pulled off of the stems and roughly chopped
8 oz fusilli (or your favorite pasta!)
olive oil
½ can of cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
pesto (canned or your fav homemade recipe)
a handful of toasted, roughly chopped pecans (about ¼ a cup)
a couple stems of scallions, whites and greens, for garnish and texture
Cook pasta according to instructions.
After draining pasta, in same pot, add about ½-1 tbsp olive oil and saute kale until bright green (a couple minutes). Add beans to warm.
Mix all ingredients (pasta, kale/bean, pesto, pecans, and scallions) and serve (I like to serve it warm). Top with Parmesan before eating!
If you want to try kale pesto, here are a couple recipes:
The Kitchn’s
Bon Appetit’s
Shutterbean’s
Not to sound fancy, but I’m starting to get to the point where I can just eyeball it. Really, just add these ingredients in your desired amounts: kale (and/or spinach, arugula, or the obvious–basil), 1-2 cloves garlic, some Parmesan cheese (usually at least ¼ cup), pine nuts or walnuts (lightly toasted), and olive oil until at the texture you like. Lemon juice and/or red pepper also add to the final product. Lucy Knisley illustrates it well in her book, Relish. [BUY THAT BOOK: IT ROCKS!]

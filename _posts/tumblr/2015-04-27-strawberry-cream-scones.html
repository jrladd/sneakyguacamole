<p>Cute tiny scones! Via <a href="http://joythebaker.com/2014/04/tiny-strawberry-cream-scones/">Joy the Baker</a></p><p>With this recipe, you want to be careful not to overwork the scones, because then the fresh strawberries start to smash and make the dough wet and unmanageable. Also, I needed a bit more cream to make my dough come together (maybe 1 tbsp more than she recommends)? I didn’t have a small cutter to make the tiny scones, but since I was bringing them to class for people to share, and thus wanted two bite scones, I used the top of my cream bottle to trace circles in the dough, then used a knife to cut out the scones. Worked well, but a bit of a pain! Lastly, I had to cook my scones a few minutes longer than she recommends to get a golden brown top&ndash; maybe 3 minutes more? Each oven differs.</p><figure data-orig-width="2448" data-orig-height="3264" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://66.media.tumblr.com/d1a7c7f491107a63977692c9ffff8603/tumblr_inline_nndx5n0dtv1son4ik_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="2448" data-orig-height="3264"/></figure><ul><li>3 cups all-purpose flour<br/></li><li>1 tablespoon baking powder<br/></li><li>1 teaspoon salt<br/></li><li>1/3 cup granulated sugar<br/></li><li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br/></li><li>1 1/3 to 1 &frac12; cups heavy cream plus more for brushing the top<br/></li><li>&frac34; cup coarsely chopped fresh strawberries<br/></li><li>1/3 cup chopped white chocolate (optional)<br/></li><li>turbinado sugar for topping [<i>I used regular, white sugar.</i>]<br/></li></ul><figure data-orig-width="2448" data-orig-height="3264" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://67.media.tumblr.com/be892b4aa255d8a007a926af00e1a625/tumblr_inline_nndx75FQsV1son4ik_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="2448" data-orig-height="3264"/></figure><ol><li>Place a rack in the upper third of the oven and preheat oven to 425 degrees F.

[<i>Note: was a bit hard to mix, but just try to do as softly as possible with wooden spoon and appreciate strawberries and dough will come together more when you lightly knead it in a few steps.</i>] Add 2 more tablespoons of cream if necessary to create a moist, cohesive, but not sticky dough.

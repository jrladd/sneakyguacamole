<p>Who doesn’t want to try to make lobster?! Unfortunately we live on paltry grad student stipends. However, my parents received lobster tails from my sister’s in-laws, so they let me run free and try things out. Since it was Christmas Eve, and Christmas is my mom’s birthday, I tried to plan a dish she would love, and she LOVES risotto! And while this recipe seemed a little unusual (mascarpone rather than parmesan?!), it was really creamy and the sweetness of the mascarpone matched the lobster’s sweetness.

As a Louisianian, I’ve shamed my people by never really getting into okra. However, I recently had oven roasted okra at a local restaurant and was HOOKED. Via Eating Bird Food.1 pound okra, rinsed and dried½ tablespoon olive oil2 teaspoons fresh thyme¼ teaspoon garlic powder¼ teaspoon sea saltground pepper, to tastepinch of cayenne pepper (optional)InstructionsPreheat oven to 450°.Trim the okra by cutting away the stem ends and the tips, just the very ends. Then cut the okra in half, lengthwise.Place okra in a large bowl. Add oil and spices and stir to coat the okra halves.Place okra on a baking sheet in a single layer. Roast in the oven for 20-25 minutes, shaking or stirring the okra at least twice during the roasting time. You’ll know the okra is ready when it’s lightly browned and tender.Serve hot – they tend to lose the crispy texture as they cool.

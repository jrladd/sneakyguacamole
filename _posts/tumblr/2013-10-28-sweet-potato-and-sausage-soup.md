Fall is prime soup time. Soups are easy, usually require only one bowl (and thus less clean up), and can be frozen for later eating; therefore, I make a lot of soups. YAY soups!
This post is brought to you by the amazing food blog, Smitten Kitchen, and my effusive feelings for soup.
Sweet Potato and Sausage Soup
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided1 10- to 11-ounce fully cooked smoked Portuguese linguica sausage or chorizo sausage, cut crosswise into ¼-inch-thick slices (Spanish chorizo can be substituted) (I just used hot chorizo, but really any sausage would rock.)2 medium onions, chopped2 large garlic cloves, minced2 pounds sweet potatoes (yams; about 2 large), peeled, quartered lengthwise, cut crosswise into ¼-inch-thick slices1 pound white-skinned potatoes, peeled, halved lengthwise, cut crosswise into ¼-inch-thick slices (just cut up the potatoes however you want!)6 cups chicken broth (low sodium or regular)1 9-ounce bag fresh spinach (I used kale because that was the green I had– swiss chard, kale, or any hearty leafy green would also work as well as spinach)



Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add sausage; cook until brown, stirring often, about 8 minutes. Transfer sausage to paper towels to drain. (I poured off some of the oil in the pot at this point, but the original recipe doesn’t think this is needed.) Add onions and garlic to pot and cook until translucent, stirring often, about 5 minutes. Add all potatoes and cook until beginning to soften, stirring often, about 12 minutes. Add broth; bring to boil, scraping up browned bits. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until potatoes are soft, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes. Using potato masher (or a fork), mash some of potatoes in pot. Add browned sausage to soup. Stir in spinach (or whatever green) and simmer just until wilted, about 5 minutes. Stir in remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Season with salt and pepper. Divide among bowls and serve.
Smitten Kitchen’s other options to consider: Kielbasa (suggested by commenter Wendy) instead of chorizo/linguica, adding a can or two of drained white beans or using more spinach. I love spinach wilted in soups and could have used even more.

YUM!

Season with salt and pepper. Spread vegetables evenly over bottom of pan. Place 2 rosemary sprigs on top.</p><p>Finely chop enough of remaining 2 rosemary sprigs to equal 2 teaspoons. In small bowl, combine 1 tablespoon salt and chopped rosemary. Rub mixture together with your fingertips for about 1 minute, or until fragrant.</p><p>Using sharp knife, score fat that covers top of pork by cutting shallow slashes (about ¼ inch deep) at 1-inch intervals, cutting into fat but not flesh. Rub pork all over with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Rub rosemary salt all over pork, working it into score marks, if desired, tie pork crosswise with kitchen twine in three or four places to help maintain its shape while roasting.</p><figure data-orig-width="2448" data-orig-height="3264" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://65.media.tumblr.com/c39a1f96e584a3870c3695dc2cc4c6c1/tumblr_inline_nri3stNVtO1son4ik_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="2448" data-orig-height="3264"/></figure><p>Place pork fat side up on top of bed of vegetables. Roast for about 40 minutes, or until pork is golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted into center reads 125°F. Transfer pork to serving platter. Tent with aluminum foil and let rest for 10 minutes before slicing (pork will continue to cook as it rests). <i>[Once I sliced my pork, it didn’t look quite done, so I put it back into the oven for another 10-20 minutes, and then it finished. It may be different for yours, just check your meat.]</i></p><p>Meanwhile, stir vegetables in pan and continue roasting them for about 10 minutes, or until tender and golden brown. Transfer vegetables to the platter with pork.</p><p>Add broth to hot roasting pan and bring to boil over medium-high heat, stirring with wooden spoon to scrape up browned bits in bottom of pan. Season with salt and pepper. Pour pan juices into sauceboat.</p><p>Untie pork if necessary. Slice pork and serve it with roasted vegetables and pan juices.</p>

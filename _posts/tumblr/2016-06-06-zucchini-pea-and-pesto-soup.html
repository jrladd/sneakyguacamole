<p>Man, was this fresh! I’ve decided that while zucchini are fine, I don’t really love them. They often get mushy in recipes. However, this recipe proves how great they can be! Sliced larger and not cooked long enough to become spongy, the zucchini is fantastic in this recipe. In general, this soup is reminiscent of a soup au pistou, which I love! Why not stir pesto into all soups &hellip; ?

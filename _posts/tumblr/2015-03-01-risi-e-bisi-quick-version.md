Here’s a quick & easy Risi e Bisi for the winter. When peas are in season, doing the straight up Marcella Hazan version would rock. For now, here’s the tasty Food52 recipe.14 ounce bag frozen peas (a full pound is fine, too)4 tablespoons butter2 tablespoons onion, chopped4 cups chicken stock1 cup Arborio rice½ cup Parmesan, freshly gratedIn a soup pot or dutch oven, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté until it becomes lightly golden. In a separate pot, heat the stock until it reaches a simmer.Once the onion is ready, add 3 cups of the simmering stock, the rice, the bag of frozen peas, and a good pinch of salt. Cover the pot and and cook at a low boil for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the rice is just tender. If the soup is too thick, thin it slightly with the remaining stock; it should be thick but not porridge. When the rice is ready, add the grated Parmesan and taste for salt. Serve.

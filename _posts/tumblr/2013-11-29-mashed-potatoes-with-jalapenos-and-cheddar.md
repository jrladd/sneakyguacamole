Mmmmm…
This recipe is brought to you by Food & Wine.
For 2 person Thanksgiving, I cut this in half and had lots of leftovers. In order to prepare ahead, I peeled and cut up the potatoes the day before. The morning of Thanksgiving, the potatoes looked a little browned, but still tasted delicious, FYI.

4 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces
Kosher salt
1 ½ sticks unsalted butter
1 ¼ cups whole milk
½ pound sharp white cheddar cheese, shredded (2 2/3 cups)
1 cup mayonnaise
1 large jalapeño—stemmed, seeded and minced
Freshly ground white pepper (or just regular pepper…)
In a large saucepan, cover the potatoes with water and bring to a boil. Add a generous pinch of salt and simmer over moderate heat until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain the potatoes in a colander, shaking off any excess water.
In the same saucepan, melt the butter in the milk over moderately low heat. Remove from the heat and stir in the cheese. Press the potatoes through a ricer into the pot and mix well. I didn’t have a ricer, and prefer chunkier mashed potatoes, so I just mashed them and then threw them in the pot. Fold in the mayonnaise and jalapeño and season with salt and white pepper. Serve right away.
MAKE AHEAD If you’re not serving the potatoes right away, let them cool, then transfer to a bowl or large resealable plastic bag and refrigerate for up to 3 days. Rewarm the potatoes in the microwave in 2-minute intervals, stirring each time, until hot.
YUM.

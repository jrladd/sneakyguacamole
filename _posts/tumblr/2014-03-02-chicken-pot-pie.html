<p>This is a quick and easy weeknight dinner, especially if you&rsquo;ve already got cooked chicken around (for me, it was extra from making pho, but you could also get a rotisserie chicken). I sort of made up my own recipe from a couple different online recipes, but this is <a href="http://parade.condenast.com/169831/donnaelick/one-skillet-chicken-pot-pie-in-just-30-minutes/">the link</a> to the main one I used as a resource.</p>

<ul><li>3 Tbsp unsalted butter</li>
<li>1 lb boneless skinless chicken breast, cut into bite size pieces</li>
<li>½ tsp black pepper</li>
<li>½ tsp kosher salt</li>
<li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
<li>3 cups chicken stock <i>(I only needed two cups)</i></li>
<li>2 cups frozen vegetables , (corn, <a href="http://parade.condenast.com/tag/Peas?lc=int_mb_1001">peas</a> and carrots) <i>(I used fresh vegetables that I parboiled before adding to the skillet&ndash; I carrot, &frac12; onion, 1 celery, 4-5 mushrooms).</i></li>
<li>3 oz fresh Parmesan cheese, grated</li>
<li>1 tsp dried parsley</li>
</ul><p><b>Cheesy Drop Biscuits:</b></p>
<ul><li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
<li>2 oz fresh Parmesan cheese, grated</li>
<li>1 Tbsp baking powder</li>
<li>1 Tbsp granulated sugar</li>
<li>½ tsp kosher salt</li>
<li>½ cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
<li>1 cup whole milk</li>
</ul><p><b>DIRECTIONS</b></p>
<ol><li>
<p>Preheat oven to 450°F.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Melt butter in a (10-inch) oven safe skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook until chicken is browned, about 2 minutes each side. <i>My chicken was cooked already, so I just put it on long enough to heat up the chicken.</i></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add flour and whisk to combine. <i>(I don&rsquo;t know if I used the whole &frac14; cup of flour. I just made sure the chicken all were somewhat coated in flour. Later, after the vegetables were added, I felt the base was too soupy, even after adding only 2, not 3, cups of broth. Therefore, I added a bit more flour then. It&rsquo;s to your taste.)</i></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Slowly add chicken stock while whisking skillet. Whisk until well combined. <i>(How she expects you to whisk when there&rsquo;s chicken in the pot, I have no idea. Just sort of mix as you can.)</i></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add in vegetables and cheese.<i> (I also think I reduced the amount of parmesan cheese, just because we&rsquo;re also using parmesan chicken. You can just add as much cheese as you feel is enough. For me it was a couple of tablespoons.)</i> Stir to combine. Reduce heat to medium. Allow mixture to come to a boil, stirring occasionally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meanwhile: In a large mixing bowl combine flour, cheese, baking powder, sugar and salt. Whisk to combine well. Add butter and milk. Stir to combine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drop biscuits by the rounded tablespoon full on top of pot pie. Place skillet on cookie sheet and then slide into the oven. Bake for 10-12 minutes, until biscuits are golden brown.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sprinkle with fresh parsley<i>, if you like,</i> serve and enjoy.</p>
</li>
</ol>

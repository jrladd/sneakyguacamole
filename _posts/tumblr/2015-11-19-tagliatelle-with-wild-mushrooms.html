<p>I really loved this, but this is one of those recipes that I think just wouldn’t work as well without fresh pasta. The sauce is so subtle that the texture of fresh pasta is half the pleasure, so give fresh pasta making a try! Via <a href="http://www.tastingtable.com/cook/recipes/homemade-pasta-tagliatelle-recipe-mushroom-pasta-sauce">Food 52</a>. (While the original recipe has a fresh pasta recipe, I highly recommend a more simple version: Marcella Hazan’s pasta recipe.)</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="2856" data-orig-width="2441"><img src="http://67.media.tumblr.com/773beb9f82034836f164cf48b34b8f72/tumblr_inline_nx9o68vIIT1son4ik_540.jpg" data-orig-height="2856" data-orig-width="2441"/></figure><ul><li>4 tablespoons olive oil<br/></li><li>½ medium yellow onion, very finely diced<br/></li><li>4 cups (about 8 ounces) assorted mushrooms (such as maitake, morels and king trumpets), cut or torn into thin slices<br/></li><li>¼ cup chicken stock<br/></li><li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter<br/></li><li>¼ cup finely grated Parmesan cheese, plus more to top<br/></li><li>2 tablespoons finely chopped flat-leaf parsley, divided<br/></li><li>2 teaspoons finely chopped rosemary, divided</li></ul><ol><li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.<br/></li><li>In a large skillet over medium heat, warm the oil.

<p>John and I often throw this together for dinner, and his grandmother used to make it for him. We usually slice up sausages in casing into &frac12; inch discs, but in this case, we had bulk sausage (Italian, chorizo, whatever kind you like/have). This is one you just throw together based on how much of everything you have, but I&rsquo;ll lay out a general plan here.</p>
<ol><li>Preheat your oven to 350 degrees.</li>
<li>Cut up 2-3 sausages (or &frac12;-1 lb), 1-2 peppers, one medium/large onion, and a couple potatoes (depending on their size, I do like 4 hand sized yukon golds). Season with salt and pepper and any other seasonings you like (I like to add cayenne if I want it spicy, or oregano and thyme for a more italian tasting dish). I bake this in a glass casserole dish, but you can do it in a dutch oven, a deep cookie pan, etc.</li>
<li>Bake until potatoes are soft and sausage is crispy, between &frac12; hr and one hour.Â </li>
</ol><p>Enjoy! (And thanks to John for help with this one.)</p>

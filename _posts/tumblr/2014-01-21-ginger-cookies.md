HOLIDAY GIFT PALOOZA PART 3: big, soft cookies
Once again, missing pictures. Also, while these cookies are delish, mine came out flat. While it may have been because of the weather, I think refrigerating the dough would have helped, so consider doing that step before baking.
Thanks allrecipes.com and Andy, our sweet IT volunteer at the library, who put me on to these cookies!

2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour


2 teaspoons ground ginger


1 teaspoon baking soda


¾ teaspoon ground cinnamon


½ teaspoon ground cloves


¼ teaspoon salt


¾ cup margarine, softened


1 cup white sugar


1 egg


1 tablespoon water


¼ cup molasses (I used sorghum because that’s what I had. . )


2 tablespoons white sugar

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Sift together the flour, ginger, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, and salt. Set aside.
In a large bowl, cream together the margarine and 1 cup sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg, then stir in the water and molasses. Gradually stir the sifted ingredients into the molasses mixture. Shape dough into walnut sized balls, and roll them in the remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar. Place the cookies 2 inches apart onto an ungreased cookie sheet (with parchment paper), and flatten slightly.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. Store in an airtight container.

Sauteed Cauliflower and Apples with Pecans: Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the shallot and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, 3 to 4 minutes. (At this point, I made this more of a white wine sauce for flavor– add a ½ cup white wine and a couple tablespoons butter.) Add the cauliflower and ¼ teaspoon each salt and pepper and cook, tossing occasionally, until golden, 4 to 6 minutes. Add the apple, thyme. Add a little (¼-½ cup) water if it seems dry. If you made a white wine sauce, you probably won’t need this water. Cover and cook until the cauliflower is tender, 8 to 10 minutes more, then add pecans and cook for a minute or two more. You can roast the pecans (at 350) for 5 or so minutes before adding them if you want, but it’s not necessary.

A simple Lidia Bastianich recipe thrown together with things in the pantry/fridge, via Chatelaine. 1 lb penne¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil6 garlic cloves, sliced1 tsp chopped rosemary2 8-oz pkg mixed mushrooms, thickly sliced1 tsp salt1 bunch green onions, chopped1 ½ cups ricotta¼ cup parsley, roughly chopped½ cup grated grana padano or parmigiano reggiano BOIL a large pot of salted water. Cook penne according to package directions. HEAT a large frying pan over medium. Add oil, then garlic, and cook until sizzling, 30 sec. Stir in rosemary until fragrant, 10 sec. Increase heat to medium-high, then add mushrooms and salt. Cook until mushrooms are browned, 3 min. Season with fresh pepper. Add green onions and cook until wilted, 2 minutes. Ladle in 1 cup pasta water and simmer until mushrooms are tender, about 10 min. SCOOP penne from boiling water and add directly to mushroom mixture. Stir in ricotta and parsley, adding additional pasta water if required. Cook until warmed through. Remove from heat and stir in grana padano.Tips: Lidia says to use the kitchen’s most important ingredient: common sense. Here are three things every pasta chef should knowStart with sliced garlic (not minced)“This way you can see it — if you want to eat it, go ahead, but if not, put it to the side. Finely chopped garlic gets all over the place, and then it stays with you for a long time.”Don’t drain the pasta“Cooked pasta should have resiliency. Cook it about two minutes less than the package instructs, then transfer from the boiling water into the sauce using a spider [a long-handled mesh strainer]. And always reserve the pasta-cooking water.”Add pasta-cooking water to make sauce“Add the cooked pasta to the pan, then ladle in some pasta-cooking water. It’s the secret ingredient. Add as much or as little as you need to make it flowing, not sticky or soupy. Sauté a few minutes — the pasta will absorb the flavours and the sauce will intensify.”

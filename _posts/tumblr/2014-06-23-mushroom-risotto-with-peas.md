This is a special recipe for John and I. We cooked it on our first Valentine’s Day, just when I was learning to become less picky. To this day, it’s one of our go-to recipes. I’m sad to say I don’t know where it originally came from …4-6 cups canned low-salt chicken broth (I often do 4 cups of broth, then if needed, 1-2 cups water)
½-ounce dried porcini mushrooms
¼ cup unsalted butter
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cups finely chopped onions
10 ounces white mushrooms, finely chopped (I use cremini)
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 ½ cups arborio rice 
2/3 cup dry white wine
¾ cup frozen peas, thawed
2/3 cup grated Parmesan
Salt and freshly ground black pepper, optional

Bring the broth to a simmer in a heavy medium saucepan. Add the porcini mushrooms. Set aside until the mushrooms are tender, about 5 minutes. Keep the broth warm over very low heat.


Melt the butter in a heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add olive oil. Add the onions and saute until tender, about 8 minutes. Add the white mushrooms and garlic.


Using a slotted spoon, transfer the porcini mushrooms to a cutting board. Finely chop the mushrooms and add to the saucepan. Saute until the mushrooms are tender and the juices evaporate, about 5 minutes.


Stir in the rice and let it toast for a few minutes. Add the wine; cook until the liquid is absorbed, stirring often, about 2 minutes.

     5. Add 1 cup of hot broth; simmer over medium-low heat until the liquid      is absorbed, stirring often, about 3 minutes. Continue to cook until the        rice is just tender and the mixture is creamy, adding more broth by              cupfuls and stirring often, about 28 minutes (the rice will absorb 6 to 8        cups of broth).
    6.Stir in the peas. Mix in the Parmesan. Season with salt and pepper, to     taste.

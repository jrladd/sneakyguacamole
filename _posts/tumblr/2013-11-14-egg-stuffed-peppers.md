So, a Cajun + an Italian = a ridiculously delicious household. John and I both come from food-centric cultures and love to share our recipes with each other. For me, cooking and sharing food is the way I express that I care for someone, so I think it’s neat and special when I make one of John’s family’s recipes. Or maybe I’m just silly and squishy inside. :P
This recipe is brought to you by John’s tiny 4''8" Brooklyn/Long Island Italian American grandma and weeknight cooking!

This recipe is pieced together from John’s childhood, so we just kind of wing it a little. It’s perfect because you don’t need much to make it and it’s hard to mess it up.

Bell peppers (this time, I made 5)
Eggs (generally, about twice as many eggs as peppers, so about 10 eggs in this case)
Bread crumbs (we use flavored ones so we don’t have to use more herbs, but whatever you have works– if you’re adding herbs, garlic and oregano would be good)
Parmesan cheese (in equal amounts with the bread crumbs, maybe a ½-¾ cup of each?)
tomato sauce (optional but delish)
Oven at 350 degrees. Get a casserole dish and add some tomato sauce to the bottom so your peppers don’t stick to your dish. Don’t want tomato sauce? Just put them on a baking sheet that you’ve covered with a lightly greased aluminum foil sheet.
Cut the tops off your peppers and empty them out of seeds, etc and place them in the tomato sauce-d casserole dish.
Make your mixture. Crack your eggs in a medium bowl, scramble them a bit, and add salt and pepper to your liking. Add your bread crumbs and parmesan and mix. You’re looking for a pourable consistency, with enough bread crumbs to soak up the eggs so the mixture isn’t just liquid-y and eggy. Pour this mixture into the empty peppers.
Pop the peppers in the oven. Fact: this always takes longer to cook than you think. I would give it at least 30-45 minutes. Check every so often with a toothpick or fork. When you stab the pepper filling, your toothpick should come out dry. You’re shooting for a kind of fluffy, souffle consistency for your egg filling. 
Once it’s finished, garnish with tomato sauce and parmesan as you wish.


YUM!

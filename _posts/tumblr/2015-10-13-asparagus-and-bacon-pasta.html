<p>A necessity recipe&ndash; when you’ve got nothing in the fridge! I pulled from these two recipes to make this concoction: <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/05/lemony-pasta-with-asparagus-and-bacon-recipe.html">Serious Eats</a> and <a href="http://www.gimmesomeoven.com/5-ingredient-bacon-asparagus-pasta-recipe/">GimmeSomeOven</a>.</p><figure data-orig-width="2448" data-orig-height="3264" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://67.media.tumblr.com/d1f22e0dcd138e30d61cea1e14d98b62/tumblr_inline_nvogi3vjNV1son4ik_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="2448" data-orig-height="3264"/></figure><ul><li>&frac12; lb. (8 oz.) pasta (preferably a spaghetti-like shape)</li><li>4-6 strips bacon, finely sliced</li><li>&frac12; lb. (8 oz.) fresh asparagus, ends trimmed and cut into 2-inch pieces</li><li>&frac14; cup dry white wine (or you can double this if you&rsquo;d like)</li><li>&frac12; cup grated or flaked Parmesan cheese</li><li>1 tablespoon juice and 1 teaspoon zest from 1 lemon <i>(if have)</i></li><li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li><li>Salt and pepper</li></ul><p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add asparagus and cook until just tender but still bright green, about 2 minutes. Transfer to an ice bath to chill. Dry and set aside. Keep water on stove for pasta, and cook the pasta in a large pot of salted water al dente according to package instructions. Set aside a &frac14; of your pasta water when draining pasta.<br/></p><p>Add bacon to a large saucepan or dutch oven and set over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring frequently, until bacon is crisp and rendered, about 5 minutes. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon and set aside. Add asparagus to the pan and saute in the bacon grease for about 5-6 minutes, stirring occasionally, until cooked. Remove asparagus with a slotted spoon, and set aside with the bacon. Slowly add the white wine to the pan, and scape the bottom of the pan with a spoon to deglaze the pan and pick up all of those yummy brown bits. Continue cooking for 5 minutes, or until the wine has reduced by about half. Add lemon juice and zest, butter, and plenty of black pepper. Stir until butter is melted.</p><p>When the pasta is cooked, drain it. Then add the pasta, asparagus, bacon and &frac14; cup Parmesan cheese to the saute pan, and toss until combined. If the pasta seems too dry, add in the pasta water a bit at a time and toss to combine, until desired consistency is reached.</p><p>Sprinkle pasta with the remaining Parmesan cheese and serve immediately.</p>

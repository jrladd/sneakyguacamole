<p>Probably not the best mac and cheese I&rsquo;ve made, but I like the comfort foody-ness of <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/tyler-florence/mac-n-cheese-with-bacon-and-cheese-recipe.html">this recipe.</a>Â Also, don&rsquo;t forget&ndash; you can always tweak recipes! I made only a portion size of this recipe and adjusted based on what I had in the house (using dried herbs, subbing part of the cheddar with parmesan, adding breadcrumbs etc).</p>

<ul><li>Kosher salt</li>
<li>1 pound elbow macaroni</li>
<li>4 cups milk</li>
<li>2 or 3 sprigs thyme</li>
<li>4 cloves garlic, smashed and divided</li>
<li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
<li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
<li>5 &frac12; cups shredded sharp white Cheddar</li>
<li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
<li>&frac14; cup chopped flat-leaf parsley</li>
<li>4 slices bacon, cut crosswise into thin strips</li>
<li>1 large onion, diced</li>
<li>2 garlic cloves, smashed</li>
<li>Leaves from &frac14; bunch fresh thyme</li>
</ul><ol><li>Bring a pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the macaroni and cook for 8 to 9 minutes, until al dente. Drain.</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.</li>
<li>In a small saucepan heat the milk with the thyme sprigs and 2 garlic cloves. </li>
<li>Melt the butter in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Whisk in the flour and cook for about 1 minute, stirring constantly, to keep lumps from forming. </li>
<li>Strain the solids out of the milk and whisk it into the butter and flour mixture. Continue to whisk vigorously, and cook until the mixture is nice and smooth. </li>
<li>Stir in the 4 cups of the cheese and continue to cook and stir to melt the cheese. Season with salt and pepper. </li>
<li>Add the cooked macaroni and the parsley and fold that all in to coat the macaroni with the cheese mixture. </li>
<li>Scrape into a 3-quart baking dish and sprinkle with the remaining 1 &frac12; cups cheese. </li>
<li>Bake for 30 minutes, or until hot and bubbly.</li>
<li>While that bakes, heat a saute pan. Add the bacon, render the fat and cook until crispy. Add onion, garlic and thyme leaves and cook for about 5 minutes to soften the onion. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
<li>To serve, scatter the bacon mixture over the mac and cheese. Use a big spoon to scoop out servings, making sure you get some of the smoking bacon mixture on each spoonful.<br/><br/><br/></li>

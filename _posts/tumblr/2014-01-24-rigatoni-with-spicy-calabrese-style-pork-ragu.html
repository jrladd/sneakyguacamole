<p>My one and only new years resolution is to try to cook more meat this year. I find cooking meat terrifying. I think I&rsquo;m going to food poison myself, and I don&rsquo;t understand how to trim the fat or slice the meat or what the hell to do with bones. And the feeling of raw meat in your hands &hellip;  it&rsquo;s taking some getting used to. But I&rsquo;m determined. Sausage and ground meats are a good way to start, to build up my confidence. And what a great way to start, delish; thanks <a href="http://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/rigatoni-with-spicy-calabrese-style-pork-rag">Bon Appetit</a>!</p>

<ul><li>1 medium onion, quartered</li>
<li>1 carrot, peeled, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
<li>1 celery stalk, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
<li>4 garlic cloves</li>
<li>2 teaspoons fresh oregano leaves</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
<li>1/2 cup coarsely chopped flat-leaf parsley, divided</li>
<li>1 28-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes</li>
<li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
<li>1 pound hot or sweet Italian sausage, casings removed</li>
<li>1 pound ground pork</li>
<li>Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper</li>
<li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
<li>1 pound mezzi rigatoni or penne rigate <i>(I used fusilli)</i></li>
<li>3/4 cup finely grated Parmesan or Grana Padano plus more</li>
</ul><p><i>*I cut the meat content in half, only using &frac12; lb hot sausage and &frac12; lb pork, because 2 lbs of meat just sounded like too much for me. I kept all the vegetables the same measurements, and I found it still came out great. But if you like a meatier sauce, you go on! </i></p>
<ol><li>Pulse onion, carrot, celery, garlic, oregano, red pepper flakes, and &frac14; cup parsley in a food processor until finely chopped; transfer to a small bowl and set aside. Purée tomatoes with juices in processor; set aside.</li>
<li>Heat oil in a large heavy pot over medium heat; add sausage and cook, breaking up with a spoon, until browned, about 4 minutes. Add ground pork, season with salt and pepper, and cook, breaking up with a spoon, until no longer pink. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a plate.</li>
<li>Increase heat to medium-high. Add reserved vegetable mixture to drippings in pot, season with salt, and cook, stirring often, until golden, 8-10 minutes.</li>
<li>Stir tomato paste and 1 cup water in a small bowl; add to pot. Cook, scraping up any browned bits from bottom of pot. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until liquid has almost evaporated, 6-8 minutes.</li>
<li>Add reserved meat and tomato purée and 1 cup water <i>(I didn&rsquo;t add as much water, I found the juices from the tomato to be enough. Later I added maybe a &frac12; cup or less).</i> Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, adding more water as needed to keep meat nearly submerged, until meat is tender, about 4 hours. <i>If you want to do 4 hours, rock on. But I cooked mine for about 1 &frac12; hrs and thought it was fine that way. </i>Season with salt. **DO AHEAD: Ragù can be made 3 days ahead. Let cool. Cover and chill, or freeze for up to 2 months. Reheat before continuing.</li>
<li>Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until al dente. Drain, reserving 2 cups pasta cooking liquid.</li>
<li>Add pasta and &frac12; cup pasta cooking liquid to sauce; stir to coat. Stir in &frac14; cup Parmesan and remaining &frac14; cup parsley. Increase heat to medium and continue stirring, adding more pasta cooking liquid as needed, until sauce coats pasta. <i>(Once again, I didn&rsquo;t find I needed to add any water. This may be because I had less meat, but you can just do it based on preference.) </i>Divide among bowls; top with more Parmesan. </li>
</ol><p><i>To give you a proportional sense, four friends and I had plenty to eat on this. </i></p>
<p><b>YAY!</b></p>

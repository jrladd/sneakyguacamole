This is Joy the Baker’s campfire scone recipe! These were really tasty, and I’m sad that I waited so long to blog this, because now the link to the recipe is broken on her site! For now, ogle. I’ll try to get the recipe up eventually!

Edit: She re-posted it! Here’s the recipe. I thought it was great. I couldn’t get her marshmallow icing to work. So for my second attempt I used Alton Brown’s meringue recipe, and that worked out well for me.

<p><b>Jacques Pepin&rsquo;s Beef Stew in Red Wine Sauce</b></p>
<ul><li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
<li>2 pounds trimmed beef flatiron steak or chuck, cut into 8 pieces <i>(I used stew beef from my CSA)</i></li>
<li>Salt</li>
<li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
<li>1 cup finely chopped onion</li>
<li>1 tablespoon finely chopped garlic</li>
<li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
<li>One 750-milliliter bottle dry red wine <i>[I use Trader Joe&rsquo;s Two Buck Chuck of Pinor Noir]</i></li>
<li>2 bay leaves</li>
<li>1 thyme sprig</li>
<li>One 5-ounce piece of pancetta <i>(I used 4 slices of bacon because I&rsquo;m not fancy and thus don&rsquo;t just have pancetta in my life)</i></li>
<li>15 pearl or small cipollini onions, peeled <i>(Once again, not fancy, so I just chopped up an onion)</i></li>
<li>15 cremini mushrooms</li>
<li>15 baby carrots, peeled <i>(Or slice up 2-3 regular carrots)</i></li>
<li>Sugar</li>
<li>Chopped fresh parsley, for garnish</li>
</ul><ol><li>Preheat the oven to 350°. In a large enameled cast-iron casserole, melt the butter in 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Arrange the meat in the casserole in a single layer and season with salt and pepper. Cook over moderately high heat, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides, 8 minutes. Add the chopped onion and garlic and cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until the onion is softened, 5 minutes. Add the flour and stir to coat the meat with it. Add the wine, bay leaves and thyme, season with salt and pepper and bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve any brown bits stuck to the bottom of the pot.</li>
<li>Cover the casserole and transfer it to the oven. Cook the stew for 1 &frac12; hours, until the meat is very tender and the sauce is flavorful.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, in a saucepan, cover the pancetta with 2 cups of water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 30 minutes. Drain the pancetta and slice it &frac12; inch thick, then cut the slices into 1-inch-wide lardons.<i> [I just sliced up my bacon into &frac12; in or so slices and fried them in a saucepan. You don&rsquo;t want them too crispy, just nicely browned.]</i></li>
<li>In a large skillet, combine the pancetta, pearl onions, mushrooms and carrots. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil, &frac14; cup of water and a large pinch each of sugar, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, cover and simmer until almost all of the water has evaporated, 15 minutes. Uncover and cook over high heat, tossing, until the vegetables are tender and nicely browned, about 4 minutes.</li>
<li>To serve, stir some of the vegetables and lardons into the stew and scatter the rest on top as a garnish. Top with a little chopped parsley and serve.</li>

<p>I like to be able to serve my stew on something; I always make cheddar muffins, beer bread, or some type of bread to pour the stew over. </p>

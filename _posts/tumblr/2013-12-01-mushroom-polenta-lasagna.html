<p>This name is a lie. There is not a stitch of pasta in this recipe, so I don&rsquo;t want to lead you astray. Instead, you layer the ingredients like a lasagna. Yes? We&rsquo;re on the same page? Yay! Cause it&rsquo;s SO tasty. </p>
<p>This recipe is brought to you by <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchens/mushroom-polenta-lasagna-recipe/index.html">Food Network magazine</a> and feeding guests, which I LURVE.</p>

<p>I was a dummy and took a picture of this BEFORE it baked, which is a shame, because it looks lovely when cooked&ndash; the cheese gets melty and browned and the whole dish is bubbly. </p>
<ul><li>Note: This recipe fed four of us, and provided at least 1 leftover serving for each of us. So, let&rsquo;s just acknowledge, this makes A LOT OF FOOD.</li>
</ul><p><b>For the sauce:</b></p>
<ul><li>1 &frac12;-ounce package dried porcini mushrooms, rinsed <i>(I had just a dried wild mushroom mix. These are worth buying, because you can use dried mushrooms for mushroom risotto and other recipes as well.)</i></li>
<li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
<li>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
<li>1 pound button mushrooms, trimmed and quartered <i>(I prefer cremini)</i></li>
<li>1 pound shiitake mushrooms, stems removed, caps quartered <i>(If shiitake are too expensive, just reduce the amount of shiitake and up the regular mushrooms, but don&rsquo;t leave out the shiitake altogether because they really make the recipe.)</i></li>
<li>Kosher salt</li>
<li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
<li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
<li>&frac14; teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
<li>3 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
<li>1 15-ounce can whole San Marzano tomatoes, crushed by hand <i>(or whatever means you like, I use an immersion blender or a fork)</i></li>
<li>&frac12; cup chopped fresh parsley, plus more for topping <i>(optional)</i></li>
</ul><p><b>For the lasagna:</b></p>
<ul><li>2 &frac12; cups instant polenta</li>
<li>Kosher salt</li>
<li>1 cup grated parmesan cheese (about 4 ounces)</li>
<li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
<li>&frac14; teaspoon grated nutmeg</li>
<li>Extra-virgin olive oil, for the baking dish</li>
<li>3 cups grated part-skim mozzarella cheese</li>
</ul><p><b>Directions</b><br/>Make the sauce: Soak the dried porcini in 3 cups hot water, 30 minutes. Drain, reserving 2 cups of the soaking liquid. Roughly chop the porcini.<br/><br/>Heat 1 tablespoon each butter and olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add half of the button and shiitake mushrooms and cook, undisturbed, until slightly browned on the bottom, about 2 minutes. Continue to cook, stirring, until soft, 2 to 3 more minutes; transfer to a bowl. Repeat with another 1 tablespoon each butter and olive oil and the remaining button and shiitake mushrooms. Transfer to the bowl and add &frac12; teaspoon salt.<br/><br/>Reduce the heat to medium and add the remaining 1 tablespoon each butter and olive oil to the skillet. Add the onion and porcini and cook, stirring, until the onion is soft, about 4 minutes. Stir in the garlic and red pepper flakes. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring, until darkened, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the reserved 2 cups porcini liquid, the crushed tomatoes, button and shiitake mushrooms and &frac12; teaspoon salt. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 30 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the parsley; season with salt.<br/><br/>Prepare the lasagna: Bring 7 cups water to a boil in a large saucepan; transfer to a large heatproof bowl. Meanwhile, bring 3 cups water to a boil in a separate large saucepan. Gradually whisk the polenta and 1 &frac12; teaspoons salt into the bowl of hot water. Cover the bowl tightly with foil and set over the saucepan of boiling water. Reduce the heat so the water is simmering; cook the polenta until the liquid is absorbed, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat, uncover and vigorously whisk in the parmesan, eggs and nutmeg. <i>(I just cooked polenta like I normally do. Two cups of water to each cup of polenta. Or, 1 cup milk, 1 cup polenta, for richer, creamier polenta.Then, added parm, eggs, and ground nutmeg.)</i><br/><br/>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly brush a 3-quart baking dish with olive oil <i>(or just spray with cooking spray)</i>. Spread one-third of the polenta in the dish and top with half of the mushroom sauce. Sprinkle with 1 cup mozzarella. Repeat the layers (polenta, sauce, mozzarella), then top with the remaining polenta. (If the polenta gets too thick, whisk in a little hot water.) <br/><br/>Loosely cover the dish with foil and bake until bubbly, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Turn on the broiler. Uncover the lasagna and top with the remaining 1 cup mozzarella; broil until melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley. Let stand 15 minutes before serving.</p>
<p><b>YUM!</b></p>

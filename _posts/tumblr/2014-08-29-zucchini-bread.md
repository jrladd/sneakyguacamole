Have I mentioned lately that almost everything I try from the Smitten Kitchen blog comes out perfectly? Often any problems are user errors on my part. This is also one of those goofy situations when I didn’t take any pictures (except one random one during the process…see below, haha). I made the loaf as a gift for two people, then used the extra batter for muffins John and I took on a road trip. When I cook for others, I don’t always remember to document it …
3 eggs
1 cup olive or vegetable oil [don’t worry, it seems like a lot but it’s OK!]
1 ¾ cups sugar
2 cups grated zucchini
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3 cups all-purpose flour
3 teaspoons cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon nutmeg
1 teaspoon baking soda
½ teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
½ cup chopped walnuts or pecans (optional)
1 cup dried cranberries, raisins or chocolate chips or a combination thereof (optional)

Preheat oven to 350°F.


Grease and flour two 8×4 inch loaf pans, liberally. Alternately, line 24 muffin cups with paper liners. – I made a 9x13 loaf pan and about 10 or so muffins. 


In a large bowl, beat the eggs with a whisk. Mix in oil and sugar, then zucchini and vanilla.


Combine flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, baking soda, baking powder and salt, as well as nuts, chocolate chips and/or dried fruit, if using.



Stir this into the egg mixture. Divide the batter into prepared pans.


Bake loaves for 60 minutes, plus or minus ten, or until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean. Muffins will bake far more quickly, approximately 20 to 25 minutes. [Just check every 10 minutes or so if you worry, as I do.]

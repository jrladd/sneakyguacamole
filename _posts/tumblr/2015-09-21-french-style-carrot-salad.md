My fella and I recently had a fantastic shredded carrot salad with harissa at a cute cocktail bar in town. I think I’ve aired my grievances against salad on this blog before. Therefore, when we got a $12 plate of shredded carrots, I was skeptical. However, it was probably the best carrot I’ve ever had! Therefore, I told my fella I’d try to make a carrot salad at home and I really enjoyed this French-style carrot salad via Orangette. 1 lb. carrots3 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice2 Tbsp. extra virgin olive oil¼ tsp. salt, plus more to taste1/8 tsp. pressed or crushed garlicRinse and dry the carrots, and trim away their ends. Cut them into short segments, and using amandoline or food processor fitted with the julienne blade, cut them into matchsticks. [If you don’t have a mandoline or food processor with the proper blades, you can also grate the carrots on the large-holed side of a box grater, but they won’t be quite as crisp or as pretty.]Put the julienned carrots in a medium bowl, and toss them well with the lemon juice. Add the oil, salt, and garlic, and toss again to mix well. Taste, and adjust seasoning as necessary. Serve.

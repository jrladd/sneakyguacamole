Living out my Southern heritage. Via My Name is Yeh. 4 large green tomatoes (or 6 smaller ones)kosher salt and black pepper¾ c flour1 ½ c panko bread crumbs1 ½ tsp sweet paprika2 large eggs¼ c buttermilkPreheat the oven to 400F and place an oven-frying rack (or metal cooling rack) over a large baking sheet and set it aside.Cut the tomatoes into thick slices and season both sides with salt and pepper.Set up three bowls: one with the flour, one with the panko, paprika, and a pinch of salt and pepper, and one with the eggs and buttermilk (beat them to combine). Coat each tomato slice in flour, and then the egg mixture, and then the panko and then place on the oven-frying rack one inch apart. Spray the tops with cooking spray and then bake for about 20 minutes, until golden brown. let cool slightly before serving

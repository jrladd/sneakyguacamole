<p>This is one of those great recipes that make you wonder: is it really worth it? Oh man, a delicious parmesan-y taste that is perfect for the winter. If you can get affordable parmesan rinds (I can get them for $5.99 for 1 lb at my local Whole Foods), I recommend this recipe. I served it with spaghetti noodles, white beans, kale, and a soft boiled egg.

Simmer for one hour. Pour broth through a strainer. Your yield should be approximately 4 &frac12; cups. You can use this right away or cool it before storing it.</p><p><b>Turn the broth into soup:</b> Prepare kale by removing tough stems and center rib (I often use kitchen shears for this), then cutting the leaves into thin ribbons. Add them to the broth, along with the beans. Add bean cooking liquid if you wish; this not only stretches the intense parmesan broth further but adds a gorgeous extra depth to the soup. Simmer ingredients together for 10 minutes, until kale leaves wilt and beans are warmed through.</p><p><b>To serve:</b> Ladle a small amount of beans, kale and broth into a bowl. Top with a slice of toasted baguette. Drizzle baguette and soup lightly with your favorite olive oil and grate some fresh parmesan cheese over. Eat immediately.</p>

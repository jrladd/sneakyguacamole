A surprisingly easy way to make fresh pasta, via A Cup of Jo.1 large egg1 large egg yolk16 oz. ricotta (about 2 cups)½ tsp. freshly ground black pepper½ cup finely grated Parmesan (plus more for serving)½ tsp. kosher salt1 cup all-purpose flourOne jar high-quality marinara sauce [or homemade, I just whipped some up quick on the stove while putting the gnocchi together]Olive oilKosher saltFresh basil (optional)In a large bowl, whisk egg and egg yolk. Add ricotta, pepper, Parmesan cheese and kosher salt, and mix until well combined. Add flour; stir just until combined and mixture forms a ball. Add more flour as necessary if the dough is too wet.Making the gnocchi is easiest with some team work! Dust a rimmed baking sheet generously with flour. Have one person use 2 large soup spoons to shape heaping tablespoonfuls of dough into football shapes and then place them on the baking sheet. Have the other person roll the gnocchi with more flour so that they are coated (you should have around 50). [I don’t have a picture of how I made the shapes with the spoons, but on the original recipe site, she’s got a really good pic.]Cook gnocchi in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through and tender, 5-6 minutes. (The gnocchi will quickly float to surface, but continue cooking for the entire 5 to 6 minutes until they are fully cooked.)Remove the gnocchi with a slotted spoon and transfer to a plate. In a skillet, heat a few drizzles olive oil, then add the gnocchi and gently pan fry for a few minutes on each side, until lightly browned. Add marinara sauce and stir to evenly coat.Remove the pan from the heat and serve immediately. Serve topped with Parmesan cheese and fresh basil sliced in thin strips (chiffonade), if desired.

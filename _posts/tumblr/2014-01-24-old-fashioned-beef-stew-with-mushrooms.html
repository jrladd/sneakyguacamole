<p>Great winter treat. I usually make Jacques Pepin&rsquo;s <a href="http://sneakyguacamole.tumblr.com/post/67337499083/beef-stew-and-beer-bread">beef stew in red wine</a>, but I wanted to try something more traditional, which this is&ndash; it even has a roux to thicken it up. Different, but equally tasty. You decide which is better! Thanks to <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/old-fashioned-beef-stew-with-mushrooms.html">Food Network magazine</a>!Â </p>

<ul><li>6 tablespoons grapeseed or olive oil, plus more as needed</li>
<li>3 pounds beef chuck, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
<li>Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper</li>
<li>4 carrots (1 roughly chopped, 3 cut into &frac12;-inch rounds)</li>
<li>4 stalks celery (1 roughly chopped, 3 cut into &frac12;-inch pieces)</li>
<li>1 onion, roughly chopped</li>
<li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
<li>1 cup hearty red wine, such as shiraz</li>
<li>2 quarts beef stock or reduced-sodium beef broth</li>
<li>2 sprigs thyme</li>
<li>1 &frac14; pounds russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks</li>
<li>1 pound mixed mushrooms (such as cremini, chanterelle, oyster and/or stemmed shiitake), sliced or quartered if large</li>
<li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
<li>&frac12; cup all-purpose flour</li>
<li>Chopped fresh parsley, for topping</li>
</ul><ol><li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Season the beef with 2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Add to the pot in batches and cook, turning and adding more oil as needed, until browned all over, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl with a slotted spoon.</li>
<li>Add 2 more tablespoons oil to the pot and reduce the heat to medium. Add the roughly chopped carrot, celery and onion and cook, occasionally stirring with a wooden spoon and scraping up the browned bits on the bottom of the pot, until the vegetables soften, about 5 minutes. Move the vegetables to one side and add the tomato paste to the empty side. Cook until it darkens around the edge, about 2 minutes; stir into the vegetables. Add the wine and bring to a boil.</li>
<li>Return the beef and any juices to the pot; add the stock. Bring to a boil, skimming any foam off the top. Add the thyme. Reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer until the beef is tender, about 2 hours.</li>
<li>Strain the beef and vegetables in a colander set over a large bowl, reserving the cooking liquid. Tent the beef mixture with foil. Let the cooking liquid stand for 5 minutes and then skim off the fat on the surface. Return the liquid to the pot. Add the remaining carrots and celery and the potatoes and bring to a simmer over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until the vegetables are just tender, about 20 minutes.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms; cook, stirring occasionally, until they release their juices and brown, 10 minutes. (Pour off any extra liquid, if necessary.) Season with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat and set aside.</li>
<li>Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk in the flour to make a roux, then let it bubble (do not brown), 2 minutes. Whisk in 2 cups of the reserved cooking liquid. Stir this sauce into the pot with the vegetables; bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium low and simmer, stirring often, until thickened, 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Return the beef to the pot, discarding the roughly chopped carrot, celery, onion and thyme <i>(I dunno. I&rsquo;m of the opinion, the more veggies the better. So I just cut them normally, instead of roughly, and just left them in the finished product&ndash;except for the thyme stems, of course. Tasted good to me!)</i> Add the mushrooms and simmer until heated through, 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper; sprinkle with parsley.</li>

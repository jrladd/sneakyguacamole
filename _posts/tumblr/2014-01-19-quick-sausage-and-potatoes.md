John and I often throw this together for dinner, and his grandmother used to make it for him. We usually slice up sausages in casing into ½ inch discs, but in this case, we had bulk sausage (Italian, chorizo, whatever kind you like/have). This is one you just throw together based on how much of everything you have, but I’ll lay out a general plan here.
Preheat your oven to 350 degrees.
Cut up 2-3 sausages (or ½-1 lb), 1-2 peppers, one medium/large onion, and a couple potatoes (depending on their size, I do like 4 hand sized yukon golds). Season with salt and pepper and any other seasonings you like (I like to add cayenne if I want it spicy, or oregano and thyme for a more italian tasting dish). I bake this in a glass casserole dish, but you can do it in a dutch oven, a deep cookie pan, etc.
Bake until potatoes are soft and sausage is crispy, between ½ hr and one hour. 
Enjoy! (And thanks to John for help with this one.)

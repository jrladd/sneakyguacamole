So the picture for this isn’t very cute, but I will say its looks are deceiving because it was quite tasty. I riffed off this Emeril Food Network recipe, making it vegetarian.


6 portobello mushrooms, stemmed (reserve 1 cup minced stems)
3 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling
½ cup finely chopped onion
¼ cup finely chopped green bell pepper
¼ cup finely chopped celery
2 teaspoons minced garlic
½ cup plain bread crumbs
½ cup freshly grated Parmesan
¼ cup plus 1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley leaves
2 teaspoons Essence, recipe follows
1 egg, lightly beaten
Essence:
2 ½ tablespoons paprika
2 tablespoons salt
2 tablespoons garlic powder
1 tablespoon black pepper
1 tablespoon onion powder
1 tablespoon cayenne pepper
1 tablespoon dried oregano
1 tablespoon dried thyme
Combine all ingredients thoroughly. Yield: 2/3 cup
**Note: we only made 3 caps, so I halved this recipe and it went fine. As for essence, I didn’t mix it. I just powdered a little of each of essence’s ingredients in the food processor step.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.Using your hands, lightly rub each portobello mushroom with 2 teaspoons of olive oil.To a pan, add olive oil, then when hot, add the onion, bell pepper, celery, and mushroom stems and cook until softened, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Remove from heat.Transfer vegetable mixture to the bowl of a food processor. Add ¼ cup of the bread crumbs, ¼ cup of Parmesan, ¼ cup of parsley, the Essence, and the remaining 2 teaspoons of olive oil. Pulse until mixture is finely chopped and comes together slightly, about 30 seconds. Transfer the mixture to a bowl, add the egg, and stir until well combined.Divide the filling among the mushroom caps, about ½ cup for each mushroom. Place the filled mushrooms on a baking sheet. Combine remaining ¼ cup of bread crumbs and ¼ cup of Parmesan in a small mixing bowl. Divide the bread crumb mixture evenly among the tops of the mushrooms. Bake until golden brown on top and the mushrooms are tender, about 15 to 18 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool slightly. Garnish with remaining tablespoon of parsley, drizzle with olive oil and vinegar and serve warm or at room temperature.

Easy & delicious weeknight meal, via Joy the Baker. 3 tablespoons olive oil1 medium yellow onion, sliced thin8 large eggs½ cup heavy cream (or whole milk is great too)2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme¼ cup  chopped fresh parsley½ teaspoon salt½ teaspoon fresh cracked black pepper½ cup whole-milk ricottaPlace rack in center of the oven and preheat oven to 375 degrees F.Heat oil in a 9-inch, oven proof skillet over medium heat.  Add sliced onions and saute until browned and cooked through, about 5 to 7 minutes.  While onions are cooking, in a medium bowl, whisk together eggs, cream, fresh herbs , salt and pepper.When the onions are done cooking, reduce heat to low.  Add the egg mixture and allow to cook and set over low heat, about 8 minutes.  Dollop ricotta over eggs in six dollops.  Place frittata in the oven to finish baking.  Bake for 10 minutes, or until eggs are set and no longer giggle (or jiggle)  in the center.Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 5 minutes and serve warm or at room temperature.

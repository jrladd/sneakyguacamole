<p><b>Pastry </b></p>
<p><b><i>[*Note: I found this made more dough than I needed, so you could probably reduce the recipe by 1/3-&frac12; if you want. I just froze my extra for future use]</i></b></p>



<ul><li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
<li>2 tablespoons snipped chives <i>(I didn&rsquo;t have chives and it still tasted good)</i></li>
<li>&frac34; cup unsalted butter, chilled, cut into small pieces</li>
<li>1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
<li>2 egg yolks</li>
<li>6 tablespoons heavy cream</li>
</ul><p><b>Chicken and Vegetables</b></p>



<ul><li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
<li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
<li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
<li>2 medium carrots, cut into &frac12;-inch slices</li>
<li>1 stalk celery, cut into &frac12;-inch slices</li>
<li>&frac12; pound crimini or shiitake mushrooms, sliced</li>
<li>1 x 10 ounce package frozen pearl onions, thawed <i>(I just cut up a small yellow onion since I didn&rsquo;t have pearl onions)</i></li>
<li>&frac34; cup frozen petite peas, thawed</li>
</ul><p><b>Sauce</b></p>



<ul><li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
<li>&frac14; cup all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1 &frac12; cups chicken stock</li>
<li>&frac12; cup heavy cream</li>
<li>1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme <i>(I always love fresh herbs, but don&rsquo;t be afraid to sub dried. It&rsquo;s usually about &frac12; of the amount of dried that you would do fresh.)</i></li>
<li>
salt
</li>
<li>
Freshly ground black pepper
</li>
<li>
1 egg with 1 tablespoon water, beaten
</li>
</ul><ol><li>Prepare the pastry: Place the flour and chives in a bowl. Using a pastry blender or your fingertips, work in the butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add the cheese and work in until just blend.  In a small bowl, whisk together the yolks and 5 tablespoons of the cream. Sprinkle the yolk mixture over the pastry dough, a little at a time, stirring with a fork until pastry comes together. Add remaining cream if necessary. <i>(I used a food processor for my dough.) </i>Knead lightly until just combined. Press pastry into a circle. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until needed. </li>
<li>Heat a large skillet over medium high heat and add the butter and vegetable oil. Sauté the chicken for 2-3 minutes, until lightly browned but not cooked through. With slotted spoon, remove chicken to bowl. <img src="" alt="image"/></li>
<li>In the same pan over medium-high heat sauté the carrots, celery and mushrooms 5 minutes. With slotted spoon, remove vegetables to another bowl. Stir thawed pearl onions and peas into vegetables. <img src="" alt="image"/></li>
<li>Prepare the sauce: In the same pan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the flour and whisk until the mixture is bubbling and smooth, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and gradually whisk in stock, cream, and thyme. Return skillet to heat, bring to a simmer, stirring constantly. Cook for 2 minutes until sauce has thickened and is smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in reserved chicken and vegetables. Set aside to cool for about 20 minutes. </li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Spoon cooled chicken and vegetable mixture into a 10-inch deep-dish pie plate. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pastry into a circle 11-inches in diameter. Place pastry on top of chicken mixture. Trim pastry edge, fold overhang under and press gently all around the baking dish to make a decorative edge. Reroll any trimmings and cut out to make a decorative design for top of pie. Brush pastry with beaten eggwash. Using a knife, cut 3 slits in center of pie. </li>
<li>Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until pastry is golden brown, chicken and vegetables are tender and filling is heated through.</li>

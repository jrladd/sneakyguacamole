This was a rare occasion where I found the original recipe I referred to to be not very well written. Therefore, I’ve adjusted the recipe where needed, and in the end, it really was a good mac and cheese. Via Chasing Delicious.½ pound miniature elbow pasta2 oz butter1 small onion, finely sliced1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves, finely chopped¼ cup flour2 cups milk, warm1 cup cream, warm1 bay leaf12 ounces cheese, chopped into small chunks or gratedSalt & Pepper to taste2 ounces parmesan cheese, gratedInstructionsPreheat an oven to 350°F. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook the pasta in the boiling water according to the instructions, cooking it only until it is al dente.In a separate pot on the stove or in the microwave, heat cream and milk until warm.In the meantime, heat the butter in a separate, large pot or dutch oven over medium-low heat. Add the onion and thyme. Cook until the onions are translucent, about 5 to 10 minutes.Reduce the heat to low and add the flour and cook, stirring frequently, for about 2 minutes.Add the milk, cream, and bay leaf. Stir or whisk until the flour and butter is completely dissolved. Cook over low-medium heat, stirring frequently, until the mixture begins to thicken.Add the cheese, in small handfuls at a time, stirring after each addition until the cheese is completely melted. Keep the low heat during this stage. Add salt and pepper to taste, and remove bay leaf.Once all the cheese is melted and added, add the drained pasta and mix in well.Pour the mac & cheese into two small or one large oven-safe casserole or keep in oven safe dutch oven. Sprinkle the parmesan cheese and a little pepper over the top.Bake until the cheese is bubbly and the top golden brown, about 30 minutes.

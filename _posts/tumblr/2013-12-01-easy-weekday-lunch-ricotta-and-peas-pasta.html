<p>This is a great fall back recipe for John and me. It requires so little time and ingredients. All you need is small pasta (preferably orzo, but as you can see in the picture, we had ditalini), ricotta, frozen peas, and fresh/dried basil. So this recipe is brought to you by low funds and laziness.</p>

<p>You could easily make this dish to various proportions but for us, we generally follow:</p>
<ul><li>&frac12; lb orzo</li>
<li>&frac12; cup of frozen peas</li>
<li>Two tablespoons or more ricotta</li>
<li>a few shakes of dry basil (if fresh, maybe 5-6 leaves)</li>
<li>pepper</li>
</ul><p>Add orzo to boiling water and follow cooking instructions. With about 5 minutes left on cooking time, add peas to pot of boiling pasta. Drain all and add back to pot (or a bowl). Mix in ricotta; add more or less depending on the creaminess you prefer. Add in basil and pepper to taste. Easy peasy lemon squeezy.</p>
<p><b>YUM.</b></p>

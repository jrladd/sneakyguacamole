<p>This <a href="http://www.macheesmo.com/2009/10/olive-bread/">olive bread</a> was a great variation on the no-knead bread. Easy and delish. Definitely remaking this. </p>

<ul><li>3 Cups Bread Flour </li>
<li>1 &frac12; Cup Kalamata Olives, pitted, drained, roughly chopped </li>
<li>&frac34; Teaspoon active dry yeast </li>
<li>1 &frac12; Cups cool water </li>
</ul><ol><li>Drain the olives and pat them dry. Then give these guys a rough chop and make sure that all the olives actually don’t have pits.</li>
<li>Mix your yeast and flour together in a large bowl and then toss in your chopped olives. Don’t worry. The olives won’t turn the bread a strange color. Then add your water and mix everything together using your hand or a large spoon. After just a few seconds you should have a pretty moist ball of dough. It should be very wet. You wouldn’t be able to knead this even if you wanted to.</li>
<li>Cover this and let it sit at room temperature for 14-18 hours. (It should be like double to triple in size and look like an amazing bubbly mess.)</li>
<li>Next, take a large tea towel and sprinkle it liberally with flour and corn meal. If you don’t have corn meal you can just use flour, but corn meal adds a great texture to it. </li>
<li>Scrape your dough (you’ll need to scrape it) out onto a floured surface and just fold it a few times, liberally flouring both sides if it is sticking. Eventually you want to form a ball or loaf with it.</li>
<li>Turn this onto your floured towel with the seam side down on the towel. The seam side by the way, is the side that’s on top in the above photo. So I flipped it so that was down on the floured towel. (You could always refer to my <a href="http://sneakyguacamole.tumblr.com/post/74362919713/boule">boule</a> post, and make this seam through a gluten cloak.)</li>
<li>Cover that towel and let the loaf ferment and proof for another two hours.</li>
<li>After your bread has been proofing for about 90 minutes, preheat your oven to AS HOT AS YOU CAN. For me this was 500 degrees.</li>
<li>Heat your dutch oven in the oven for at least 30 minutes so it is as hot as can be. <b>Don’t preheat the lid in the oven.</b> Just the pot itself.</li>
<li>Once your pot is blazing hot, pick up the towel with the dough on it and roll the dough into the pot so the seam side is up again! </li>
<li>Put the lid on the pot and cook it for 30 minutes. Then take off the lid (be really careful of escaping steam). Cook it for another 20 minutes or so until the crust is a dark, walnut brown.</li>
<li>Let it cool on a wire rack for an hour before slicing it.</li>
</ol><p>AWESOME.</p>

<p>What happens when it’s finals season and you have no food except for leftovers from a graduate reading group? You make it work. Via <a href="http://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/january-2008-baked-pasta-with-onion-bacon-and-brie">Food and Wine</a>.</p><p>I only had 5 oz of brie left over so I made a half recipe and made up for the 1 oz of brie by adding about &frac14; cup of grated Parmesan. I also added a bit more pasta (more like 8 oz, rather than the &frac12; recipe amount of 6 oz). Lastly, though the sauce looked a bit thick, it coated the pasta well and was yummmmyyy.</p><figure data-orig-width="2448" data-orig-height="3264" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://67.media.tumblr.com/87f2ab6f76fd7611261587f4fc64f1ad/tumblr_inline_nndv16OtuM1son4ik_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="2448" data-orig-height="3264"/></figure><ul><li>4 ounces sliced bacon, cut into 1-inch strips [<i>I cooked my bacon then crumbled it rather than pre-slicing it.</i>]</li><li>1 medium onion, thinly sliced [<i>I diced it.</i>]</li><li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li><li>1 cup whole milk</li><li>12 ounces Brie, rind removed, cheese cut into 1-inch chunks</li><li>12 ounces fusilli</li><li>Salt and freshly ground pepper</li><li>3 tablespoons freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li></ul><figure data-orig-width="2448" data-orig-height="3264" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://66.media.tumblr.com/55c22b22efb4027d07ae89d2bf365eb4/tumblr_inline_nndv6iQOc01son4ik_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="2448" data-orig-height="3264"/></figure><ol><li>Preheat the broiler and position a rack 6 inches from the heat. In a deep, medium skillet, cook the bacon over moderately high heat until browned and crisp, about 6 minutes. Drain the bacon on paper towels and discard all but 1 tablespoon of the fat in the skillet.</li><li> Add the onion to the skillet and cook over moderate heat, stirring, until softened and lightly browned, about 6 minutes. Add the flour and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the milk and whisk until the sauce is thickened and bubbling, about 3 minutes. Turn off the heat and stir in the Brie until completely melted. [<i>For me, my brie wouldn’t melt til I put the sauce back on heat, but then it only took a minute or two on low heat.</i>]</li><li> Meanwhile, in a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the fusilli until al dente; drain well.</li><li> Add the fusilli to the sauce in the skillet and toss. Add the bacon and season with salt and pepper. Transfer the pasta to an 8-inch baking dish and sprinkle the Parmigiano-Reggiano on top. Broil for 5 minutes, until the cheese is golden, shifting the pan for even browning. [<i>I added panko bread crumbs for a crunch and that browned much more quickly&ndash; 2-3 minutes?</i>]</li><li>EAT!</li></ol>

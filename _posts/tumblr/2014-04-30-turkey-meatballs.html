<p>So my good buddy MERRILL (one of the few people who actually reads this blog . . ) turned me on to this recipe by making her own lamb-based version of this and blowing John and my MINDS. However, I had some frozen turkey from my CSA I needed to use, so I went back to the source&ndash; the <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/book/">Smitten Kitchen cookbook</a>. Is it better with lamb? What isn&rsquo;t, really? But I very much recommend this recipe!</p>

<p><b>Sesame Spiced Turkey Meatballs</b></p>
<ul><li>1 pound ground turkey</li>
<li>2/3 cup fresh breadcrumbs (from 1 to 2 slices sandwich bread)</li>
<li>&frac14; cup water</li>
<li>1 tsp table salt</li>
<li>1 large egg</li>
<li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
<li>&frac12; tsp ground cumin</li>
<li>&frac12; tsp ground coriander</li>
<li>&frac12; tsp Aleppo pepper <i>(just did a little cayenne instead, but I&rsquo;m thinking about investing in some Aleppo pepper&ndash;it&rsquo;s real neat!)</i></li>
<li>Pinch of cayenne pepper, or &frac14; tsp Aleppo red pepper flakes</li>
<li>2 Tbsp sesame seeds, toasted <i>(i skipped this but I bet it&rsquo;s good)</i></li>
<li>Olive oil, to coat the pan<b><br/></b></li>
</ul><ol><li>
<p>Preheat oven to 400. Combine all the meatball ingredients in a medium bowl with a fork, breaking up the clumps of meat until the ingredients are evenly distributed. Form turkey mixture into 1 &frac12; inch, or golf-ball-sized, meatballs, and arrange them on a tray. (Perelman recommends first wetting your hands, making it easier to form the meatballs and keep them from getting sticky.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heat a generous slick of oil in a large ovenproof saute pan with a lid. Brown the meatballs in batches, being careful not to crowd the pan or nudge them before they are nicely browned. These meatballs are soft, so use a gentle hand. Transfer the meatballs to a paper-towel-lined tray, and continue cooking in more batches until they are browned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discard the oil, and wipe all but a thin layer from the pan. Return all of the meatballs to the pan, and transfer to preheated oven. Bake until a thermometer reads an internal temperature of 160 to 165, or about 10 to 15 minutes.</p>
</li>

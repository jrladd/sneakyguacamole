Om nom.

2 pounds summer squash and/or zucchini, cut into matchsticks
1 teaspoon kosher salt plus more
¼ cup sliced almonds
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 garlic cloves, sliced
¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
¼ cup finely grated Parmesan
Freshly ground black pepper

Place squash in a colander set in the sink or over a large bowl and toss with 1 teaspoon salt. Let squash stand 10 minutes, then squeeze well to remove as much excess moisture as possible (do not rinse).


Meanwhile, toast almonds in a large dry skillet over medium heat, tossing occasionally, until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate; let cool. [I skipped this, but I bet it’s good …]


Heat oil in same skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring often, until fragrant but not browned, about 2 minutes. Add squash and cook, tossing occasionally, until crisptender, about 5 minutes. Fold in Parmesan and season with salt and pepper. Fold in almonds.

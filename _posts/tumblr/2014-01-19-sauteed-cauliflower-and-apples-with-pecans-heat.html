Add the shallot and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, 3 to 4 minutes. <i>(At this point, I made this more of a white wine sauce for flavor&ndash; add a &frac12; cup white wine and a couple tablespoons butter.) </i>Add the cauliflower and ¼ teaspoon each salt and pepper and cook, tossing occasionally, until golden, 4 to 6 minutes. Add the apple, thyme. <i>Add a little (&frac14;-&frac12; cup) water if it seems dry. If you made a white wine sauce, you probably won&rsquo;t need this water. </i>Cover and cook until the cauliflower is tender, 8 to 10 minutes more, then add pecans and cook for a minute or two more. <i>You can roast the pecans (at 350) for 5 or so minutes before adding them if you want, but it&rsquo;s not necessary. </i></p>

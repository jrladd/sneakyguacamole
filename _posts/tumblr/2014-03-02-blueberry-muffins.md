Of course, I fail with the pictures again. [Picture update!] I think when I’m baking things for other people, I just space out. I made these muffins for my book club that I run for the library I work for. They were a great accompaniment to our book Wild by Cheryl Strayed (check it out!). Makes 9 to 10 standard muffins (for me, it made 12)
5 tablespoons (2 ½ ounces or 71 grams) unsalted butter , softened
½ cup (3 ½ ounces or 100 grams) sugar
1 large egg
¾ cup sour cream or plain yogurt (I used plain Greek yogurt)
½ teaspoon grated lemon zest (I’ve made this recipe with and without the zest, but if you have it, add it! It makes a difference. But it is also delicious without, so don’t run to the store just for this)
1 ½ cups (6 ¾ ounces or 191 grams) all-purpose flour
1 ½ teaspoon (7 grams or ¼ ounce) baking powder
¼ teaspoon (1 gram) baking soda
¼ teaspoon (2 grams) salt
¾ cup (3 ¾ ounces or 105 grams) blueberries, fresh or frozen (if frozen, don’t bother defrosting)
Preheat oven to 375°F. Line a muffin tin with 10 paper liners or spray each cup with a nonstick spray. 
Beat butter and sugar with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add egg and beat well, then yogurt and zest. 
Put flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt into a sifter and sift half of dry ingredients over batter. Mix until combined. Sift remaining dry ingredients into batter and mix just until the flour disappears. 
Gently fold in your blueberries. The dough will be quite thick (and even thicker, if you used a full-fat Greek-style yogurt), closer to a cookie dough, which is why an ice cream scoop is a great tool to fill your muffin cups. You’re looking for them to be about ¾ full, nothing more, so you might only need 9 instead of 10 cups. 
Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until tops are golden and a tester inserted into the center of muffins comes out clean (you know, except for blueberry goo). Let cool on rack (ha), or you know, serve with a generous pat of butter.

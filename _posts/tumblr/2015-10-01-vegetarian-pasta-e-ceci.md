While I’ve made a great pasta e ceci before, this is a different, vegetarian version! It is more of a soup than the other recipe, but both are DELISH. Via Vegetarian Times.1 tbsp olive oil1 medium onion, chopped (1½ cups)3 sprigs fresh rosemary2 cloves garlic, minced (2 tsp.)3 plum or Roma tomatoes, seeded and chopped (2 cups)1 15-oz. can chickpeas, rinsed and drained, or 1½ cups cooked chickpeas4 cups low-sodium vegetable broth½ cup ditalini or tubetti½ tsp. freshly ground black pepper6 tbsp grated Parmesan cheese2 tbsp finely chopped fresh basil or parsley, for garnish1. Heat oil in large soup pot or  Dutch oven over medium heat. Add  onion and rosemary sprigs, and sauté  5 to 7 minutes, or until onion has softened.2. Add garlic, and sauté 30 seconds. Add tomatoes, and season with salt,  if desired. Sauté 3 to 5 minutes. Remove rosemary sprigs.3. Add chickpeas, and slightly  mash with fork or potato masher to thicken soup.4. Add broth, and bring to a boil.  Add pasta, and cook 1 minute less than package directions suggest.5. Season soup with salt, if desired,  and pepper. Garnish each serving with  1 tbsp Parmesan and 1 tsp basil.

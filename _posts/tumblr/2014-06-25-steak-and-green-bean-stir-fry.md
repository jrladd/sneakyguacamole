A first attempt at steak via Curtis Stone’s What’s For Dinner.


3 tbsp oyster sauce
2 tbsp Chinese rice wine or dry white wine
2 tbsp soy sauce
2 tbsp canola oil
1 lb flank steak, excess fat trimmed and cut across the grain into ¼ in slices
1 lg red bell pepper, cored, seeded, and cut into strips
8 oz green beans, trimmed and cut in half on the diagonal
½ cup thinly sliced shallots
2 lg garlic cloves, finely chopped
2 tbsp finely chopped peeled fresh ginger
3 lg scallions (white and green parts), thinly sliced on the diagonal
1 tsp toasted sesame oil
fresh cilantro leaves (optional, garnish)
2 tsp sesame seeds (optional, garnish)
rice, for serving
1. In a small bowl, mix ¼ cup with oyster sauce, rice wine, and soy sauce; set aside. Heat a wok or large skillet over high heat. Add 1 tbsp of the canola oil and swirl it to coat the cooking surface. Add the beef, spreading it out in a single layer, and cook, without stirring, for about 2 minutes, or until well browned on the bottom and remove from pan. [I turned it til I was sure it was brown on all sides.]


2. Add the remaining 1 tbsp canola oil to the wok, then add the bell peppers and green beans and cook, stirring often, for about 2 minutes, or until the vegetables soften slightly. Stir in the shallots, garlic, and ginger, then stir the oyster sauce mixture, add to the wok, and cook, stirring often, for about 2 minutes, or until the vegetables are crisp-tender and the sauce has reduced slightly. Return the beef and its accumulated juices to the wok, add the scallions, and stir for about 1 minute, or just until the beef is heated through. Stir in the sesame oil and reduce from heat.
3. Serve over rice!
This wasn’t my favorite recipe, but it was good! I think pounding out the steak or slicing it in half long ways would have made the texture of the meat better for me.

Cut each on the bias into 1-inch lengths. There should be about 1 ½ cups. Rinse well and drain.Add the asparagus to the boiling water and cook about 2 minutes. Remove asparagus with a slotted spoon and set aside.Drop the fettuccine into salted boiling water. Let cook to desired degree of doneness (cooking time will range from about 2 to 2 ½ minutes for fresh pasta to 9 minutes or more for dried). Reserve 2 tablespoons cooking water. Drain the pasta.Heat the butter in the pot in which the pasta was cooked. Add the asparagus pieces and the fettuccine. Add salt, pepper and nutmeg.

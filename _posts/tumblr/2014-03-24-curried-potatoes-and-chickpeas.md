This has been one of my standard go-tos for years. It’s so great and easy– via Food Network.

1 ½ pounds Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and cut into ¾-inch chunks
Kosher salt
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 ½ teaspoons curry powder
¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 15 -ounce can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
2 cups fried onions (one 2.8-ounce can)– this is great if you have it but if you don’t, it’s still great without
For the yogurt sauce, if you want one:
½ cup plain Greek yogurt
¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro, plus leaves for topping (I used parsley instead because it’s what I had)
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
Put the potatoes, 2 teaspoons salt and enough cold water to cover in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook until the potatoes are almost tender, 3 to 6 minutes. Reserve 1 cup cooking water, then drain the potatoes.Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the potatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 8 minutes. Stir in the curry powder and cayenne and cook, stirring, 30 seconds.Add the chickpeas, 1 cup fried onions and ½ cup reserved cooking water; cook, mashing the potatoes with a spoon, until heated through, about 3 minutes. Add more cooking water, if needed. Season with salt.Mix the yogurt, chopped cilantro, lime juice and 2 tablespoons water in a bowl. Divide the potato-chickpea mixture among bowls. Top with the yogurt sauce & the remaining 1 cup fried onions.

A good way to vegetablize your pasta cheesy goodness. Via Food 52. 1 cup chicken stock (or vegetable stock or water)2 cups whole milk½ cup all-purpose flour1 tablespoon salted butter [I personally only buy unsalted butter, so I wouldn’t worry too much about this if you’re like me.]3 cups grated sharp cheddar cheese½ cup ricotta cheese¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese1 pound elbow macaroni1 generous head of broccoli, cut into florets and stems peeled and sliced2 tablespoons toasted bread crumbs2 tablespoons olive oilHeat the oven to 400° F. Lightly oil a 9-inch square baking dish, or another baking vessel of your choice. [I used a dutch oven so I could make my mac and cheese sauce and then just add the macaroni to it. Then you also don’t have to cover it with aluminum foil later, as dutch ovens have covers.]Fill a large pasta pot with salted water and bring to a boil. In a medium saucepan [or dutch oven], bring the stock and milk to boil. Meanwhile, in a mixing bowl combine the flour, butter, cheddar, ricotta, and 2 tablespoons of the Parmesan. When the stock and milk begin to boil, slowly whisk in the cheese mixture. Reduce to a simmer and cook, stirring often, until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat.When the pasta pot boils, add the macaroni and cook until just al dente. Then add the broccoli and cook everything for a minute more. Drain.In a large bowl, mix the macaroni and broccoli with the cheese sauce [or directly in dutch oven]. Transfer it all to the baking dish and top with bread crumbs and the rest of the Parmesan. Drizzle with olive oil. Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 20 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for another 5 to 10 minutes, or until crisp and golden on top.
